I already have a detector hanging on the windshield, and don't want to also attach my cell phone to be able to view it for the two to work together.  Then I'd have two dangling wires, because it's impossible to use my cell without charging it at the same time as both Bluetooth and GPS functionality must be turned on your phone to work with the iRAD 230; for me, these are battery drainers (especially GPS).I decided to use it as the passenger to see how it worked.  I feel like trying to use it while driving would present a problem for me, as when an alert from a prior user would pop up, I would need to press whether I have seen this or if I am not sure.  The app started to remind me of a free app I have occasionally used in the past that is very similar but based solely on the \"community\" of drivers currently on the road. With that app, you report various road conditions, police sightings, hazards, etc.  As a passenger, using that app comes in handy.  The iRAD app, while looking nice and having various user settings, didn't seem as useful as the other free app called Waze.  And as this is also \"community based\" it is relying on other people for data, I wasn't getting many alerts, and the ones I did get were out-dated. Obviously more people need to be using the app for this to be effective and helpful.Pros: the app easily paired with my Bluetooth and GPS - and it alerts you to turn them on if they are off.  It also easily pairs with the detector (the one light on the iRAD will change from red to blue) and the suction cup mounts works fine holding the detector in place.I have only done in City driving while using the iRAD, so I do want to check out its Highway capabilities when I get the chance, if a road trip comes up.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great idea", "unixReviewTime": 1403222400, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2014"}

There were quite a few people asking if it would, but no definite answers when I was researching this lens before purchasing it.  It is heavy, much heavier than the stock Nikon AF VR 18-55mm lens, and bigger but it does fit perfectly onto the D3100/D3200 body just fine.  In my opinion, the larger 62mm body looks better on my D3200 compared to the smaller 52mm lens that came with the camera.The first thing that I noticed right away is that the AF works perfect now, meaning I can focus onto an object at any distance and the lens will automatically focus into it and hold that focus while I steady myself before closing the shutter.  With the Nikon VR 18-55mm lens, that thing was possessed and would rarely hold a good focus point for me, especially in low light.  In good lighting indoor our outdoor, no problems with the AF on either lens.  But in the low light, the Sigma lens works much better and I can focus onto an object much faster and take quick shots with my D3100 now.  Surprisingly, the Sigma lens motor is more quiet compared to the Nikon VR motor which really whines a lot when focusing.  The shorter time needed with focusing, and the quiet motor works great when I'm taking pictures in a quiet environment.  The 18mm view is slightly wider on the Sigma than it is on the Nikon VR 18-55mm lens, but just barely.  The picture quality in low light indoors comes out a little better compared to the Nikon VR lens, mainly due to the AF being able to hold onto a point with constantly adjusting.I'm not a professional photographer, but I can take some good portrait pictures for websites and print.  The colors with this lens are as good as the Nikon VR 18-55 with no Photoshop needed to render the color spectrum.  For an 'all around' lens with good versatility and range, I would highly recommend it for the average person who's looking to only carry one lens around to capture anything & everything.Also to note, this lens comes with a 62mm lens hood.  I didn't know it came with one, so I now have 2 since I purchased a spare lens hood with the camera.  Therefore, no need to get another lens hood if you see Amazon recommend it as part of a package.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works great on my Nikon D3100", "unixReviewTime": 1352246400, "reviewTime": "11 7, 2012"}

The specs are great and the Series 9 has an elegant, slim, solid unibody-type design. I couldn't live with less than 256GB storage and I'm really glad I didn't settle for the 128GB flavor.1) Machine is very fast - boots from cold in less than 10secs, resumes from sleep in less than 2. Incredible. Screams through any task I give it.2) Screen is about right at 1600x900 - enough pixels for side-by-side documents while not requiring a microscope to read text. Screen is matte which is nice but I am not as impressed with the color rendition as others seem to be - it's ok but nothing amazing.3) Battery life is very good - I regularly achieve 8 hours or more which for me effectively equals all day use. Very impressive.4) Audio is OK but I wouldn't use for listening to music. I did have to make a change in the audio settings to boost the max volume to a more usable level (Speaker Properties > Enhancements > Loudness Equalization).5) I liked the fnLock key with its LED which allows me to use the Fn keys for screen system controls (brightness, sound etc) without requiring the Fn button each time.While the Series 9 has a lot going for it I had to make a few adjustments to really enjoy the machine properly:-1) Downgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 7 - just couldn't get on with 8 and needed this to be focused 100% on the desktop experience. During this process I also reclaimed all the drive space partitions which gives me 230GB of usable capacity. Much happier now. YMMV.2) Touchpad - I'm used to a MacBook Pro touchpad which is pretty much perfect (even when running Windows in Bootcamp) and the Series 9 touchpad was unpleasant at first - sometimes selecting when I wanted to scroll, right-clicking when I wanted to left-click etc. In the end I found a different driver for this that solved all these issues (ironically NOT the latest version - the best was Elan version 11.6.4.001 for those interested for themselves). I also disabled right corner clicking and reversed scroll direction (\"natural\"). Feels better now.3) Keyboard backlight - there is no manual control over this if the sensor decides the room is too bright. In my experience there were times I wanted it on but the software refused me (why? let ME decide!). So I blocked the light sensor with a small piece of tape and now I have full control over brightness. Works but I really shouldn't need to do this.4) I had a key (BACKSPACE) that was temperamental - sometimes didn't register key-presses at all. I was almost going to return the machine but thought I'd try a blast of compressed air first from one of those pressurized cans with a straw. Out popped a microscopic piece of plastic debris and Voila! - now it works perfectly.5) The micro-ports are a bit of a pain - not happy about carrying adapters around for Ethernet and VGA but I got used to that with the MacBook Pro VGA dongle (didn't like it there either) and the Series 9 is much thinner - Samsung at least provide the Ethernet adapter in the box. Charger port isn't as elegant as Apple's mag-safe but it does the job.So as you can see with a few software tweaks Samsung could have had a 5-star machine - basically ship with a better touchpad driver and backlight software that gives full control to the user and you're golden.Overall though I now love my Series 9, it just needed a little TLC at the start.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Almost Perfect ...

Beasimer \"www.LBphoto.net\"", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "After using iPad covers which completely encapsulated for protection, I was a bit apprehensive to try theKensington K39785US KeyCoveron my iPad2.  I've been using the KeyCover ever since I received it 10 months ago.  I've experienced no problems from lack of protection on the back of the iPad.  The padded feet have fallen off, the finish on the back and buttons are showing wear, but overall is still functional.  I'm excited to try out both the Kensington K97007US and K97087US for use with my new iPad Air.The Kensington K97007US / K97087US KeyCover keyboard case for the iPad Air, made in China, is both a protective cover with a v3.0 bluetooth keyboard.  The iPad Air snaps securely in place with quick release corners for tablet removal. Raised corner pads keep the keys from pressing against the iPad while in storage mode, and a hidden magnet enables the sleep mode while secured in storage mode.  A magnetic well secures the iPad Air for viewing in landscape and portrait mode.  In addition to the keyboard, the package includes documentation and a USB to macro charging cable.  On the surface, both KeyCover's, weighing about 13 ounces, appear to be identical.However, there are a few differences between the two KeyCover options.  The K97087US includes backlighting with seven color options (purple, red, green, cyan, violet, yellow, cool white) and +/- brightness setting keys with a 1500 mAh battery lasting for 60 working days or 480 standby days.  The K97007US keyboard currently comes with a free skin offer valued at $29.99, valid through December 2014, to cover both the iPad Air and KeyCover with a 420 mAh battery lasts for 60 working days or 480 standby days.The KeyCovers only use a magnetic well without the stand found in older versions to support the iPad in either landscape or portrait mode.  I'm guessing the stand was eliminated due to a slimmer width.  When I use the KeyCover, it's not unusual for me to type and touch the screen to complete a task.  For instance, registering the keyboard on Kensington's website had me entering information into a web form, tapping &#34;Next&#34; buttons, and browsing for and uploading a receipt.  The iPad remains in place as long as I only use the keyboard.  Any touchscreen activity can easily lead to a falling iPad if not being careful.  Even with plenty of function keys, I can't pull up my emoji keyboard, swipe between apps, and more without touching the screen.  I'm constantly resetting the iPad during use; even when holding the iPad in place with my free hand. The lack of a stability stand is a design flaw as far as I'm concerned.The iPad Air fits into the KeyCover snugly, and includes a flexible rubber corner for simplifying removal from storage mode.  The old KeyCover, with half the height, didn't have this feature and also fit snugly at first, then over time became a snap to remove.  I'm guessing the same will happen with the new versions, with the rubber corner being a cross between past complaints and the doubled height.I'm not sure what Kensington means by 360 degree protection.  When the iPad is secured in storage mode, the back is exposed to potential scratches.  I like personalizing my iPad with a decal or skin, which offers limited protection.  I haven't yet run into an issue with this strategy and am comfortable continuing to do so.  While I understand the concerns regarding the lack of covering on the back, I had them myself; time has shown me this type of damage is not common for me.The Kensington KeyCover keyboard cover does a good job of protecting the iPad when snapped in place for storage.  Additionally the keyboard works well, with the keys responding accurately and quickly.  I'm mostly excited by the addition of backlighting, something I desired from my old KeyCover.  I use my iPad regularly in multiple environments as a laptop replacement, and find the instability issue too concerning and worrisome.  I'm not sure if other keyboard covers have this issue, but I'm going to keep looking for better options.PROS:Effective v3.0 Bluetooth keyboardEasily pairs to iPadLong lasting batteryOne year limited warrantyCONS:Lack of stability standMay be difficult to remove iPadWill not protect the iPad's back from scratches and scrapes", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Stay In The Groove: A Kensington K97007US / K97087US KeyCover Hard Case Keyboard for iPad Air Review", "unixReviewTime": 1394928000, "reviewTime": "03 16, 2014"}

I ordered a \"combo pack\" of these with varying sizes and models.  The pros and cons are identical if not so similar there is no reason to write 2 or 3 almost identical reviews.So far I love this thing.  I've seen lots of clever techniques and products for cable management.  I have tried many of them.  I was in need of some new power strips and was intrigued by the design concept of these units.  Sleek, modern looking power strip with some cable management built in.  I had seen one at home depot for full price and after looking at it out of the box the amazon price sold me.Other reviewers have taken issue with the design and materials, in particular the hinge that the cover sits on.  I agree this could be better designed or made with more durable material.  However in defense I would say that one needs to be realistic about the operating environment/conditions.  I generally take very good care of all my stuff.  Aside from my wife being a little clumsy we don't have much in the way of accidents around the house.  Now, if you have a house full of little hellions/kids/dogs/relatives running around tearing stuff up.  This thing is obviously designed and constructed for function and aesthetic, not necessarily for durability.  Further more; location location location.  A power strip is not something you generally have out and exposed where said destructive forces could have a go at it.  Would the cover hinge assembly break if I kicked it or tripped over it?  Yes it probably would, but I don't have the unit anywhere that will happen and it still meets my needs.Overall I would recommend this product provided you use some good common sense in regards to how your going to use it vs. its intended use and capabilities.

I was using a standard HDMI cable that works perfectly well but needed to move my PS3 unit further, hence the requirement for this cable. The first thing I noticed when I took the cable out of the box was how slim it was. This cable is about 3 quarters the thickness of your standard HDMI cable. I figured as long as the signal can pass through it would work. This extension piece was the end that was going into the PS3. When I booted it up I noticed flickering in the signal. Just random flickering distortion on the screen and on a couple of occasions the signal would give out completely and it was like the PS3 wasn't being read onto the TV. I tried playing with the cable and I still noticed random flickering.I used another HDMI cable, a 15 foot one that could easily reach without any extension and BAM!, the system booted up perfectly with no signal interruption whatsoever. This extension was the culprit. I think it has to do with the thickness of the cable, it may be too slim for the full signal to go from the PS3 unit to the TV. Hence, it did work, but just had signal interruption. This may be because the PS3 simply has a lot more signal to send out, therefore this extension may be ideal for units that are smaller.

Of all the reviews I read, it seemed that the Synology brand offered the best device and the most features for a home NAS.  And the only thing I noticed for complaints was the consistent report of how slow the NAS is for loading and then thumbnailing photos for use by its photo browsing software, or via its Media Server software.  Once I got the device, I validated this is a big pain with the device, but I was able to setup a process to work around the issue for me.  This work around is ok for me, since it will enable me to keep the photo service and media server service active, which my family really likes.Now that I have the device and I have loaded it with most of the content from my home PCs, I can now comfortably say that I am happy that I bought this device.  I ended up buying this drive for it:Western Digital Caviar Green 2 TB Desktop Hard Drive WD20EARX.  I still have more to play with it, and more things to setup and explore, but I've used it enough that I think I can comfortably write a review about it now.I have so far, been able to use the NAS from all 3 of our PCs, and all of our Android and iOS devices.  For Android, you can use either the Synology DSFile app, or can just use any file browser with Samba mount support.  I was able to have the kids write a document on the laptop, and then I could read the document on my tablet, make comments on it, and put it back on the share so that they could see my comments and make another pass at it.  Then when they were all done, I could go to our other PC which is hooked up to the printer and could print the document right from there.  And if I tried to edit a document that someone else had opened, I was told which PC had it open, and could ask then to close the document so I could edit it.  It worked exactly the way I wanted it to.PROS- nice and quiet.  I cannot hear the fan or the hard drive in this thing.- nice looking device- it has a lot of functional components to it.  I wanted a Media Server, FTP server, and a Windows mountable share.  I got that plus a whole lot more.- Photo browsing software is actually quite nice.  It seems to have a lot of functionality for photo browsing.  I am still playing with the features that are available so I haven't mastered everything that it can do.- Nice application support for iOS and Android platforms.  I installed the DSPhoto+ software on my wife and kids devices and they can all browse our photo library and digital camera video library with ease now.  Although I have had the ability to view photos via the PS3 using Media Server on my PC, it works so much nicer with this software.  This was a huge win for my family.  I also installed all the other DS Android apps on my tablet, and I am quite happy with what it enables.- Lots of account options for it.- I really like how they don't install every option that it offers upon initial installation.  It actually lets you chose which modules you want installed.CONS- the biggest downfall for this device is the slow thumbnail process for photos that get uploaded to the photo share.  I will detail this issue below.- the provided software was outdated and I should have just went online and obtained a new version from there.  The version I initially tried ended up messing up the date/time of the photos that I originally loaded.  Luckily I can just write a shell script to fix them all, instead of copying all the files over again.- the speed doesn't seem as quick as I was hoping it would be for file transfers, but I need to do a lot more testing of my home network to make sure it is not a network infrastructure issue.  I have a Linksys E3200 router and a gigabit network card in my PC, and I was not able to get what I thought was fast transfer speeds as I transferred files to the NAS.  So I did some testing with a 1GB movie file to see the actual speed numbers of the NAS.  Here is what I noticed:(NOTE: \"Windows D\" = my D Drive on my Windows box, and \"Windows C\" is my C drive)Source......Target......Time...MB/s...ApproachWindows D...NAS.........52s....19MB...Mapped Drive CopyNAS.........Windows D...42s....24MB...Mapped Drive CopyWindows D...NAS.........45s....22MB...FTPNAS.........Windows D...42s....24MB...FTPNAS.........NAS.........37s....27MB...Shell Command Single Drive CopyWindows D...Windows D...54s....18MB...Windows Explorer Single Drive CopyWindows C...Windows D...19s....53MB...Windows Explorer Multi Drive CopySo as shown above, the write speed of my Windows Drive can achieve up to 53MB/s when using 2 internal drives, and that speed slows down to about half that speed when the NAS is used, since the network adds overhead.  I expected the NAS to be slower than an internal drive would be, and after I went through the above test, I guess I am not as disappointed with the speed of the NAS.  After all, the NAS outperforms a single drive copy, so I think that is not all that bad.AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT- Improve upon the photo upload software and also the photo thumbnailing process to not be so slow.  This could be achieved by providing options to the user on the quality of the thumbnails.  Although its nice that the NAS wants to create 5 different sized thumbnails for each photo, this process takes a long time to achieve, even if using the provided upload software.INTERESTING THINGS I HAVE DONE WITH IT- I have been able use the PS3 Media Server to view photos stored on it.- I have used their Android and iOS apps to browse files and photos- I have been able to run those apps from outside the home network (once I opened the ports for it) so that I have my own cloud storage option no matter where I am- explored the shell scripting capabilities that it has.  I find it to be a little limited with options and commands but it is able to do most things that any Linux OS should be able to do.  (I wish it had cron though)HOW I FIXED THE PHOTO UPLOAD SPEED ISSUEMy first attempt at loading my 11,000 photos was do just do a copy of the files from my PC to the NAS.  This took a few hours to do, but once it was done, I then noticed the thumbnail status in the admin website, and it was going to take a while.  I let it run for several hours, and its performance was absolutely horrible.  I am talking about over a minute per photo.So I then re-uploaded the photos using what Synology suggests we use - the Synology Assistant Photo Uploader.  That process was certainly faster because it could use my PC's CPU to do the thumbnail process, but I still thought the performance was a bit too slow.  It was about 3 photos per minute (source photo size about 1MB).  At that rate, it would have completed in about 4 days, since my newer photos average about 3MB in size, it would take longer once it hit those larger photos.So, I did a little research and found that they use a product called ImageMagicK to create 5 thumbnails of different sizes.  (1280x, 800x, 640x, 320x, and 120x)  So I installed the same on my PC, and then wrote some CygWin scripts to go through my photo directory, and create the thumbnails on my PC.  I was able to choose a lower quality of the thumbnails to a much more reasonable number, which also saved me a bit of space on the NAS as well.  I was able to run 4 simultaneous processes, each thumbnailing different directories using the above process, and was able to generate my thumbnails in a matter of 6 hours.  Once that was done, I then zipped the thumbnails (with no compression to help with the speed of unzipping on the NAS), and then transferred a single zip per year of photos over to the NAS.  This sped up the transfer time greatly as it is much faster to transfer a few large files, than to send over 55,000 smaller files.Once the zips were on the NAS, I then wrote another shell script that I run on the NAS to unzip the file, rename each file to the proper filename (the thumbnails have a : in the filename which Windows can't handle), and then I copy the files into the proper location of the photo share.I then un-paused the thumbnail process on the NAS, and it quickly updated its count of files that needed to be processed.So given the above process, here is what I think Synology should do to improve their upload tool.1. Allow the user to chose the compression/quality rating for each of the thumbnail sizes they create.2. Allow the user to opt out of creating some of the thumbnails.  It creates 1280x, 800x, 640x, 320x, and 120x thumbnails.  I assume each is used for a different purpose.  Maybe we should be allowed to skip one or two of the 3 larger files, and have the NAS use the closest available match if the desired size is missing.3. Rename the thumbnail files so that a : is not part of the filename to make life a little easier for people who want to get the files there via other means.4. Provide the ability to do multi threaded processing when using the upload tool.If anyone is interesting in doing a similar process, here are the options I found to be good for me for the ImageMagicK software.  Of course, adjust as you see fit:convert \"$filename\" -resize 1280 -quality 60 -auto-orient \"@eaDir/$filename/THUMB_XL.jpg\"convert \"@eaDir/$filename/THUMB_XL.jpg\" -resize 800 -quality 60 \"@eaDir/$filename/THUMB_L.jpg\"convert \"@eaDir/$filename/THUMB_L.jpg\" -resize 640 -quality 60 \"@eaDir/$filename/THUMB_B.jpg\"convert \"@eaDir/$filename/THUMB_B.jpg\" -resize 320 -quality 60 \"@eaDir/$filename/THUMB_M.jpg\"convert \"@eaDir/$filename/THUMB_M.jpg\" -resize 120 -quality 60 \"@eaDir/$filename/THUMB_S.jpg\"(Once the files get on the NAS, they need to be named like: SYNOPHOTO:THUMB_XL.jpg )So is the above process something that everyone will want to do?  Most likely not.  But it is something that was important for me to be able to do, so I was glad to see that the NAS offered a Linux shell which I could run some commands through, to do this type of processing.  I will most likely still use their software upload process for converting my camera movie files, but for all large photo uploads, I will now use the scripts I wrote for my initial photo upload process.UPDATE 06/12/2012I have found one usability issue with my experience with this device so far.  I wanted to move all my music to the NAS, and then have iTunes use the mapped drive to the NAS for its storage of its library.  This did not work well at all.  If you forget the fact that I didn't find an easy way to move my existing iTunes library to another drive, the big issue I had was that when I tried to download new music from iTunes, the downloads did not work.  It failed while it tried to download and process the files.  I was left with a bunch of download.m4a audio files, non of which were able to be moved to the proper directory once the download completed, and non of which were playable.  So I had to abandon this option.  Instead, I now have to continue storing the Music on my PC, and then copy it to the NAS after it is downloaded.  I am a bit disappointed with this.  I don't know whether this issue is common to all Windows network mapped drives, or is unique to this one.  Maybe its a fault of Windows and not the drive but I won't be trying it again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great NAS, but horrible, painfully slow photo uploading", "unixReviewTime": 1338249600, "reviewTime": "05 29, 2012"}

The larger bass drivers make a huge difference in the sound, and the dynamic range overall is much better than anything I've heard before, even with traditional over-the-ear headphones.  Even with the drivers, these earbuds fit snugly and unobtrusively in your ears, and while they will try to fall out if you're working out and sweating, it's easy to just push them back in.Some people dislike the cords, which are made so that the cord to the right earbud goes around the back of your neck. They are not supposed to hang down in front like the traditional stock iPod phones.  That's why the left cord is so much shorter than the right cord.  The idea is that you can remove the earbuds from your ears (for a conversation, for example) without having them fall off, and also if one of them slides out of your ear, it won't fall off.  If you prefer the original iPod cord design, stick with another brand, but I like this design.The carrying case isn't perfect, but it's better than any I've used before.  The buds sit in a plastic tray, then you wind the cord around the outside of the tray and it slides into a squarish fabric-covered box that has a velcro closure.

You can take them on business trips on which you might otherwise regret lugging a 7 pound laptop.I recently decided to replace an eight year old HP Omnibook with an Acer Aspire One and needed a small case to move my new netbook around the landscape. I purchased one at Fry's that was made for 10\" models, but my Acer was just a skosh too big to fit in it. There are plenty of neoprene bags available for a few dollars, but I wanted something that would stand up to travel and let me fit a few small items along with the netbook.Enter the Case Logic eSling, made specifically for ultra portable PCs.Talk about a perfect solution! This bag is made from tough nylon, has an adjustably long messenger-type sling, and has lots of pockets! There's one, of course, just for your netbook and it is ingeniously designed with two long interior felt strips that grip the computer and keep even small 9 inch computers from sliding around inside. Then there is a larger pocket in front that serves as a personal items pocket, with specific places for business cards, pens, a cell phone or ipod and sunglasses. This larger pocket can accommodate letter size folders or a spiral bound notebook and your charger. There's another exterior pocket that is perfect for a magazine or your Kindle, then there is a large flap that covers it all that also has a larger zipper pocket, great for a wallet.The outside of the case is stain- and scuff-resistant black, but the inside is a burgundy colored material that makes it easy to find things. No more fishing around trying to find where you put your keys in the dark interior of your bag!The quality of this bag is what sets it apart from virtually every other netbook case out there: it is very well constructed of expensive looking materials. This bag may cost more than cheaper bags, but it will outlast them by years. The stitching is reinforced at strategic spots, the zippers are strong and durable, and even the zipper pulls look like they'll last forever. My only quibbles here are that the strap, while light weight, is less impressive than the rest of the bag, and there is no rubber feet protection on the bottom of the case where you are likely to set it down.You won't find that the bag is large enough to replace your briefcase or backpack unless you really travel light. But for quick day trips, it is a great solution for carrying your small computer and a few other items.

Lebryk", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This drive found its way into an older Sony Vaio laptop that breathed new life into an already fairly fast computer. There is nothing better than super fast boots and programs starting in almost a blink of an eye. Once you've tried an SSD, you'll wonder why you sat through all that time waiting on a mechanical drive.There are so many benchmarks on SSD's pitting them against each other. At the end of the day, this is so much faster than a mechanical drive, in the real world the differences between drives is almost impossible to detect. I bought this drive at a deep discount. If I were paying full price, or there wasn't a sale, I would buy a Samsung 840 EVO.The cautionary tale, these drives can fail. If you are saving important things on these drives, be sure to back them up routinely.This Crucial drive is a bare bones drive that has nothing additional in the box - you get the drive, that's all.Here are some detailed installation instructions:Size matters with these drives. If you are putting this in a desktop, a 240Gb drive would probably be the right size. Add a mechanical drive for data and files and you will be super happy. Install applications in the default C drive, and make sure that any files they use for data or temporary things goes to a mechanical drive. In a laptop, 240Gb might push the limits a little bit - a 500Gb will give you more room before you have to use an external drive. On my MacBook Pro, 240Gb was perfectly fine for over a year.My frame of reference is a number of SSD's. My first was the Samsung 840 with 240Gb used on a desktop computer for the boot drive and application installs. My second drive was a SanDisk 240Gb that went belly up after about eight months (that drive was in a MacBook Pro - SanDisk replaced the drive under warranty so it went into an ancient Acer Aspire One netbook running XP, and darn that machine is now super fast). I also have a Crucial M500, 240Gb drive in a Sony Vaio laptop. Being totally honest, there is absolutely no difference in apparent speed or utility with any of these four drives. They are all lightning fast. If this were a critical computer, I would buy the Samsung. If this was a play around computer, I'd buy something based on price (the Acer is a goofing around computer that I can risk it going belly up again and won't cry).This Crucial SSD is a bare bones drive. The box contains two items, the drive and a plastic spacer, nothing else. If you have done an SSD upgrade before and have the SATA to USB adapter (or a SATA drive enclosure), or are going for a clean install of the new drive; this is the drive to purchase.Once you have done the upgrade, do not repurpose the mechanical drive - simply tuck it away for the day the SSD fails. That is the fastest, easiest way to recover a failed SSD - swap the drive out. The first step after the upgrade is to do a full backup of the new drive and start using a backup strategy - TimeMachine (Mac), Second Copy (PC), and / or CrashPlan (off line backup). Be religious about your backups - do them daily.Critical first step before buying an SSD is to check how much data is on your mechanical drive. If it is less than the 246GB, the drive will work fine. If there is more than 246GB of data on the larger mechanical drive, either delete things or buy a larger SSD. The job took about four hours to do the upgrade. This was the first time I've upgraded / cloned a drive, so I worked slowly. I could probably get this done in about 3 hours now.How to perform the installation (Crucial doesn't pack much in the way of instructions or have much information on their website - you kind of have to find this stuff searching the internet):If this is a clean install - bolt in the hard drive.This might get a little complicated in a desktop; Crucial does not pack an adapter tray with the drive. You're in luck if your case has a 2 1/2 inch bay. If not, you'll have to buy an adapter plate. This OCZ plate will work just fine:OCZ Solid State Drive 3.5-Inch Adaptor Bracket 2 OCZACSSDBRKT2. Boot the computer on the installation disc and follow the instructions. Literally, there is nothing else to do. An SSD is no different from a mechanical drive for a clean install. Win7 recognizes that the drive is an SSD and adjusts the settings appropriately.If this is cloning, or copying over the exact mechanical drive to the SSD:Find cloning software. With a Macintosh, use Carbon Copy Cloner. The software is free to use as a trial to simply clone a hard drive. I didn't need any of the other functions, so I just used the trial software. SuperDuper is another Macintosh alternative. Macrium and Paragon are excellent free packages for PC's.Next you have to connect the SSD to the computer via USB. This can be done with a SATA to USB adapter. With bare bones drives, either you can buy a universal SATA to USB adapter (somewhat expensive) or a SATA drive enclosure (a lot less expensive). So go figure, it is cheaper to buy an enclosure than a simple cable. An enclosure is really a good idea - your old mechanical drive can go someplace useful after the swap - it can become a good external hard drive with an enclosure (once you are confident the new SSD works). What are the price differences? A good USB2 enclosure can be had for $8. A USB2 adapter cable is around $15. A USB3 adapter cable is around $20-29.Once the adapter is connected to the SSD, plug it into a USB port on the computer. In the world of PC and Mac the drive has to be formatted. For PC, format the drive with NTFS (use the Storage &#62; Disc Management portion of Computer Management (right click over the My Computer icon and choose Manage)). For a Mac there are some odd little steps to follow. When you plug in the drive the Disk Utility will automatically run. You have to format the drive and then go through a special HD backup partition step. Carbon Copy Cloner describes every step perfectly. Just follow those instructions.Launch the cloning software. Now comes the fun part, waiting and waiting and waiting. It took just over two hours to copy 199GB of data from my hard drive over to the SSD. It's important to understand that the SSD and the computer will get pretty darn warm while this is running. Given that it took so darn long to copy the data, and I wasn't going to format my mechanical drive right away, I didn't bother verifying the copy.Once the clone is done, shut down the computer, remove the old boot drive, and install the new SSD (dirt dog simple on a PC). On a MacBook Pro this wasn't too complicated (there are instructions all over the internet on how to open up a Mac to replace the hard drive). I pulled all the small stainless steel screws and lifted off the cover. The hard drive is to the right of the battery (the big long black thing). Be careful about not touching anything inside the computer and you don't have to unplug the battery (looking around, unplugging that thing looked more complicated than I wanted to tackle). The hard drive is held in with a clamp (like those stocks used in Colonial times to punish people - the hole for the head and two for the hands). You only have to remove the one clamp that is farthest away from the computer body. The drive will now slip out of the other clamp. Pull off the SATA connector. Remove the four mounting screws that are Number 6 Torx. There isn't really a good way to remove these without a Torx screwdriver (the screws are really tight and pliers around the screw might mess things up, you might MacGyver it, but it could go wrong).Mount the new SSD. Screw in the four Torx screws on the side of the drive. If you really want to make sure this is a secure mount, place the self-adhesive plastic spacer on the top of the drive (this is the black and red SanDisk label side), and you can remove the little plastic tab for pulling up on the drive from the old mechanical drive. Reconnect the SATA cable. Replace the stocks clamp. Replace the back cover and the stainless screws.Voila - the work is now done. Start up the computer. You will be ultra-disappointed on the first start up. Somehow the Mac got a bit confused and it took a couple of minutes to start up the first time. Once the system checking and hardware stuff was updated, and my desktop appeared, the computer was instantly available. Boot time is much faster now. I rarely power down my Mac, but cold boot a fairly fast 2 minutes with the mechanical drive. Once the desktop appeared it took another thirty seconds or so to actually be useable. With the SSD gray screen is around one minute and once the desktop appears every single program is instantly available.The big win with this SSD in Mac land is how fast applications start. Safari is virtually instant, blink of an eye. IPhoto is a little longer, maybe 10 seconds (it used to take a good 30 seconds to get rolling). IMovie is incredibly fast now. I use Microsoft Office 2011 and really hated starting up any of that software on the old drive. Now after the SSD I click on Word, the program is running within about 10 seconds. I can wait that long.The only hitch I ran into was with Microsoft Office. For some reason, once I cloned the drive, Microsoft decided I had a new installation. I had to enter my product key again. Lucky for me I could find the key. Before cloning the drive, you might want to look around for the product key in Office someplace. And actually the second time I've done the upgrade to an SSD, Microsoft was no longer happy and I had to remove the software and completely reinstall it. Downloading from the Microsoft site and asking for my Key back wasn't too difficult.This is one darn fast drive. The only thing to watch is drive space. Macs tend to throw files all over the place and not care a lot about how much storage space is used. They are then difficult to prune down to get rid of no longer needed files. I chose to copy everything over from my old drive to the new without any housecleaning beforehand. I did find a set of movies I can get rid of, leaving me with about 60 GB of free space.With an SSD, an external drive will be critical. I don't have a lot of trouble with that because I currently use a 2TB external drive for my Time Machine. Big files can sit on that drive instead of locally.I happened to have all the tools I needed for this migration. That was super lucky; I just finished building a PC with a Samsung 840 drive. If I didn't have those tools, this drive would be really hard to install. Honestly, if you don't have the tools, the Samsung is a much better, cheaper choice. Yeah, OK, somebody ran some benchmarks and says some of these drives are faster than others. That's benchmarks, not real world. At some point, a blink of an eye is fast; half a blink of an eye doesn't appear to be faster. Bottom line, you'll never see the difference with real files and real work between the drives.This is an excellent bare bones hard drive. If you've never experienced an SSD, it is the world's best upgrade you can do to speed up your computer.Hard Drive Enclosure:Vantec NexStar TX 2.5-Inch SATA to USB 2.0 External Hard Drive EnclosureSATA to USB3 Adapter cableSyba USB 3.0 to SATA Device Adapter Cable with AC Adapter (SY-ADA20079)Anker Uspeed USB 3.0 to SATA 3ft Converter Adapter Cable for 2.5 inch/3.5 inch Hard Drive Disk HDD and SSD, Power Adapter includedCable Kit USB2 SATA and IDE:Vantec CB-ISATAU2 SATA/IDE to USB 2.0 Adapter Supports 2.5-Inch, 3.5-Inch, 5.25-Inch Hard Disk Drives (Black)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Rock Solid", "unixReviewTime": 1396656000, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2014"}

Unlike the Panasonics, which required a solid day's worth of break in time to get good sound quality, these sounded crystal clear right out of the box and the bass is clear and well balanced-they sound better than the Panasonics ever did. So, if you are thinking of getting more expensive headphones like the beats solo hd's for instance, save a lot of money and get these, which have better clarity and only a little less bass-leading to, in my opinion, a better overall sound quality in these.

They were the first company to figure out that efficient quiet cooling is done with heat-pipes, copper and large slow moving fans. So when everyone else started copying their designs i remained brand loyal with them. All of their coolers are made in Korea, and the quality shows over the Chinese garbage.This cooler is no different, and does a great job of cooling an i7-860. In a Zalman HD160XT case, the CPU doesn't go over 38C, even when all 4 cores are at 60%.The only reason i'm giving this 4 stars is because Zalman really needs to offer this as an optional PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) 4-pin fan for Intel chips. Having to use the clunky fan controller might be okay if you're slumming with an AMD chip, but if you're running an Intel and a decent mobo that will control the speed of all the fans in the case this makes no sense.If you have an Intel chip/board, you're probably better off with the 9500 (Zalman Computer Noise Prevention System with Silent Fan Pure Copper Heatsink CPU Cooler CNPS9500AT) that comes with the 4-pin connector.This is too bad because otherwise the 9700 should be a better option all the way around. The amount of copper mass is enough to keep any decent chip from overheating even if the fan fails. The bigger fan (compared to the 9500) means that it can move slower and near silent and still deal with the worst gaming demands.And if you read any review that claims that this cooler is loud, i wouldn't take it too seriously. If you use the clunky fan controller you can turn the fan almost completely off, and well within the realm of silent. When the fan was running at full voltage, my cpu was @ 34C, when i turned it way down to the point of being almost inaudible the temp went to 35C. So the copper mass makes this cooler very efficient, so it really takes very little air flow to make this thing work.But seriously Zalman, you need to offer this with a 4-pin non-LED fan. Then it would be the ideal cooler for anyone whose case will not fit the crazy bigZalman CNPS9900A LED Ultra Quiet CPU Cooler. If you're case will fit the 9900, or if you are willing to mod your case, take a serious at that one because if the fan on that one ever failed it probably wouldn't even effect the temp of the cpu.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Clunky for Intel...", "unixReviewTime": 1394409600, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2014"}

The Windows are actually not Windows at all, they are called Palettes and are not supposed to be resized, otherwise anything that needs resizing, IE the image iteself can in fact be sized or viewed in the bird's eye (awesome feature). All of the Palettes can be maximized and minimized, not uncommon with Image Editors really. Lastly, the reason it looks different was not because Nikon wanted to confuse us, but rather because the previous version (awful) was created solely by Nikon, whereas this version was a collaborative effort between Nikon and Nik Software (no relation). Smart move since Camera makers are notorious for making terrible Image Editors.My opinion on this software is high, spent 30 days with the trial and then bought it I thought it was so good. It is very easy to make a crappy image look wonderful, and a great image look even better. Extremely intuitive, and user friendly palettes; standout features are three-fold-Control Points as a means to edit specifics. Allows real control over the  image and it is very logical to make impactful changes with this feature.-Edit List to show you what you have done without disturbing the original. Great because you check & uncheck what you have done and see with your eye if it was the correct choice.-Raw editing is great, no compression so your starting with great source material the way you shot it from the camera. This is really where this software shines.I would suggest spending a little time with the manual, especially if you are mostly familiar with Photochop. This software is not a chopshop, it is for balancing, and enhancing digital photographs, this is what it is designed and targeted to do, not compete head-to-head with PS. The workflows are great and easy to understand and don't interfere with anything.My only knock on this software is it requires at a bare minimum 1GB of RAM to flow, if you want it to really move plan on 2GB, it's a hog. But all software is bloated these days (particularly image editors) so I am not removing a star for this.Buy and enjoy, it will improve your editing experience.1/17/06- One MAJOR point/drawback I want to make about this software..I advanced myself into shooting and editing in RAW since I learned everything else pretty well in this software. I just want to warn anyone thinking of this software, and please PLEASE!, HEED MY ADVICE HERE. If you don't have a MINIMUM, an absolute MINIMUM! if 2GB of RAM, raw mode will crawl to the point it is so slow and innefficient it becomes not worth it. I have 1GB of RDRAM and I switched back to jpeg mode because it was awful in RAW mode. Would have loved to have had that functionality, but I am not upgrading my entire PC in order to do it.

The pulling tape on mine was also on the wrong side, but it is not a problem to edge the battery out of the housing without it. I checked that carefully, so I did not bother to reposition the tape which may or may not have stayed in reliable position over time, once removed.On the initial 24 hour charge, it ran my Dell workstation with two hard drives an i7 processor and an advanced graphics card, two monitors(22\" CRT and 24\" LCD respectively), modem and router for at least 10 minutes, while working continuously in Photoshop(I restored power thereafter) which is about what would be expected, given the estimated  particular VA rating of this load on my UPS1400 unit.The only thing about which I obviously can't comment is on how long in the future the battery will perform to backup time specification; however, as noted previously, there is a 2 year warranty which I believe is the same as the APC battery for which you will pay about 50% more, seemingly needlessly. This is my second replacement battery since I bought the unit about 6 years ago. The first replacement was an \"APC\" battery, which, as mentioned in other reviews, is not made by APC,  confirmed by a telephone call to their customer service department. While they, of course, strongly recommend replacement with \"their\" batteries, they had no rejoinder to my suggestion that the aftermarket batteries may well be just as good in quality.According to my research, American Battery seems to be a well established company with a high rating, and a very diverse inventory. I also doubt that Amazon would sell third party products that wind up being a source of complaints and demands for refunds!BTW, if having working time according to expectations from the specifications is important for your workflow, please don't rely entirely on the periodic autoload battery test which the APC units do for you, especially after the battery is >2 years old.  As the battery becomes weak, and nears the end of its life, if you have a power outage when the \"green light\" is still on, you may only get 30 seconds or a minute of backup, instead of 10 minutes or more, which is exactly what happened to me recently. So, please profit from this experience.  Interestingly, although the unit had passed all the self tests prior to that outage, giving a false sense of security, after I subsequently recharged the old battery for 24 hours and then did a MANUAL load test, the battery failed.I see no reason not to recommend this unit highly, with the sole limitation aforedescribed, as a cost effective RBC 7 battery replacement.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Equivalent Battery Replacement as OEM", "unixReviewTime": 1278115200, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2010"}

However, it was not really capable of all of the things that I wanted to be able to do with it.  Night shots were definitely in the &#34;so-so&#34; category.Many years ago I had a Pentax film camera that I loved until it was stolen.  So, when this camera became available with such a wide range lens, I just had to give it a try.Here is what I like about it:1.  If you just want to start taking pictures and are not quite ready to start changing settings, set the camera to the auto mode and you will be MORE than pleased with the results.  This camera far outperforms my prior Nikon in the auto mode.  Of course, this is a much more expensive camera, but it is nice that you can just start using it have great results!2.  Flexibility!  This camera is capable of just about anything that you want of it.  The settings are easy to work with and the symbols actually make sense.3.  Contrary to some comments, the included kit lens does a GREAT job!  The zoom is very smooth and the auto focus is quick and precise.  I have taken several macro shots (2 feet) with max zoom and the clarity is superb!  (keep in mind that you need to use a tripod if you want clarity with this type of picture).4.  The camera has a very nice feel to it and is very solid and does not feel plastic like.  The comparable Nikon and Cannon camera felt very inexpensively built compared to this camera.  I can very easily one hand this camera without issues.5.  The 16.3 MP camera delivers very nice pictures with plenty of ability to crop to be able to come out with a fantastic shot.6.  The battery lasts a VERY long time!  I have taken over 800 pictures and not had to replace the battery.What I did not like:1.  The included software is only certified for Windows 7.  When I contacted Pentax, they seemed puzzled as to why I would want to have the software certified for Windows 8 64 bit OS.  Guess it really does not matter since I have not used their software and have not had any issues with my current software (Photoshop and Corel).2.  The Pentax support people did not think that anyone would want to connect their camera to an IPAD and as such stated that it was not supported.  For the record, it works just great with my current generation Ipad and the Ipad mini.  Makes it very easy in the field to tell what type of shots you really took.  Just use the lightening to USB connector to connect to your camera cable and download the pictures.  Great while in the field to ensure your camera stays water tight and dirt free.Overall, I am very pleased with this camera and the Pentax support folks were quick to respond, even if they seem a bit in the dark about using something other than a computer to work with pictures.I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking for a entry to mid level digital SLR.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pentax K-5 II DSLR DA 18 - 135mm WR lens kit", "unixReviewTime": 1381881600, "reviewTime": "10 16, 2013"}

It looks very cool but obviously not in a hyped up teenagers spaced out gadget way...It also has a VERY shallow install depth, and in the case of some modern cars it allows all those USB Cables ample room without worrying about crushing them, and better cooling...At the time I received the unit Parrot is working on another update to its software, it does run an early vsn of android; 1.5. It's only run on the bench, I'll be doing a dash recovering/gauge cleaning in addition to installing this unit to route the cables to hidden locations...It came with a Ipod cable [a major plus because many simply make you buy the cable] GlobalSat BU-353 USB GPS Receiver with magnetic bottom, Microphone and a simple USB Extension Cable to facilitate connecting a USB drive/3G/4G Dongle without pulling the unit out and it also has a SD Slot behind the Jog wheel half of the faceplate.the SD slot, compared to all the devices I use has to be the easiest and fumble free to insert/remove, a simple click in addition to the recessed channel make it a snap..the faceplate removes/installs equally easy, and of all the units in the past that have had the removable faceplate, this one was well thought out... Begin by placing the right side of it in to the unit and at once amagnet grabs it, then simply push the left side in and its engaged.. should you be interrupted and not fully engage the faceplate the magnet has it. The faceplate once installed has almost no room to \"wiggle\" when pushing buttons, something that always erked me with my others. Once removed the weight and \"feel\" of it is solid, like holding a block of aluminum. The buttons are just the right size for large fingers and have just the right feedback. The jog wheel doesn't respond to very rapid turning, if so it will respond once in every few notches. It didn't take me too long to learn the way it navigated when browsing the 'home' menu, your jog wheel controls all up/down left/right movements and the submenu button is to its right and the wheel center is your \"Enter\" button.Another reviewer had stated a problem with 'syncing' contacts... that would be a singular issue with that user.. headunits that support phone connection will use a \"push\" feature of the BT standard to add your contacts to the headunit at connection, the manual also explains how to send only contacts you wish to have on the headunit.** Since this review installed an Offline mapping app that has trip logging and reports back to my servers, installed Navigon, a speedtrap/radar app, FTP and a general bearing/heading app with mph.. It also recognizes USB Keyboards [have one on order to use in the car for programming and logins] USB Hubs work well with it, and I've setup USB to LAN interface to AP, [wifi dongles don't work on the current release. I don't need the 3g capacity but I do want to be able to access the unit from home to allow map updating & audio transfer.. having made batch files to update USB drives on the PC I adapted them to FTP media playlist changes, maps and apps to it from inside the house..and if your a power txt'r there is a paid feature [again if your going the route of BT DUN, tethering or 3/4G dongle] that provides speech to txt by subscription...In my heading i left a 'but' however having been tooling around with the unit I am so far VERY happy that it is a unit that has some growth potential to handle other hardware and the potential for great uncomplicated driver aides..when needed..One word of caution.. if your hoping that you can tether easily.. Do your research on your cell/droid cell AND Cell plan, many carriers charge you 2 times for internet.. they call it web when Ya use it ON your phone.. DATA when you want to tether and charge Extra for it.... there are ways around it, but if your just an avg user be cautious...

{"reviewerID": "AO35VK4BB2YZR", "asin": "B001I45T9O", "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "I'd had an Acer Aspire One for a few months when my brother expressed an interest in buying a small laptop; I hatched the idea of giving him a deal on my AAO if I could find something I might like a little more. My only real dissatisfaction with my AAO (120G HD, WinXP, 3-cell model) had been battery life; watching a movie on iTunes, I could barely get through an hour and a half, and I generally had to pay a lot more attention to the battery meter than I wanted.After some research, I settled on the Samsung NC10 as something that might suit my needs better.  Both are fine machines, with very similar specs; here are my thoughts on the two, after a few months with the Acer and a few days with the Samsung.Size and weight are the biggest difference (though in fairness, a 6-cell AAO would be pretty close in weight) - but as with most tradeoffs, the right choice depends on what you want to do with it.  If I was really going to be carrying it around regularly, the Acer would be more handy.  My primary use, though, is as a \"kitchen computer\" for around the house, plus entertainment and email on the occasional trip.  Since portability is a bit less of a concern, I can afford the NC10's bigger dimensions to get the bigger screen and keyboard.Things I like about the NC10:* Bigger keyboard feels very close to full size.* The matte screen is better in many environments compared to the glossy screen of the Acer.  Flying with the Acer, I had problems with the reflections of the reading lights of the passengers behind me, and there were similar issues in other environments.  I get a bit less contrast with the NC10 -- the blacks aren't quite as black in some settings -- but it's a reasonable price to pay.* I wasn't really getting used to the Acer's touchpad buttons being on the side. The NC10's button position underneath the touchpad is more natural for me. The difference isn't as great as I had hoped, though - I'd wanted to be able to click-and-drag with one hand by using the thumb and index finger, but the touchpad area is so cramped that this is difficult, and I still resort to two hands fairly often.* Aside from positioning, the touchpad's buttons do feel more usable on the NC10; you really need to push on the Acer's buttons, while with the NC10, you can do a more gentle tap.* The NC10's labels for the side connectors, printed on the top surface around the keyboard, are a very useful touch I'd like to see more of.  Not beautiful, but a victory of function over form.* Both give on-screen feedback when you do various Fn-key operations such as turning off wireless or changing the brightness or volume, but Samsung uses nice clear graphics in the middle of the screen, while Acer's feedback is with simple and fairly light-colored text near the bottom of the screen; the latter was harder to see on light backgrounds.* Very quiet out of the box.  The Acer was just intolerably loud before I found and installed Ralf's free fan control app, which made a huge difference in the enjoyability of the AAO.* If you're hung up on fingerprints, the NC10 has hardly any surfaces that attract them.* I haven't done it yet, but I like the option of easily adding more memory.Things I miss about the Acer:* A nifty feature of the AAO's physical design is that the display's hinges are only at the sides, leaving a big gap along most of the length between the main body and the display's lid.  I found I could get a very nice one-handed grip of the open AAO by slipping three fingers into this gap (getting my medium-size male fingers in up to the second knuckle), and spreading my pinky and thumb wide underneath the unit, turning it into, well, a mighty big \"palmtop\".  This gives a very strong one-hand hold, leaving the other hand free for typing.  If you think you might be using your netbook on your feet a lot, you should definitely try the Acer on for size.  (In contrast, holding the NC10 Statue-of-Liberty style and trying to type on it isn't nearly as solid or comfortable.)* The Acer's lid opened wider, which is nicer sometimes for casual household use,  e.g. standing over a table or counter.* The Acer's status LED's are above the keyboard near the display, easily visible while you're typing; the NC10's are on the front edge (toward your body as you type).  This hides them under your hands when you're typing, and if you set the NC10 down in front of you to watch a movie, those bright blue LEDs are shining right at your face, and are a bit distracting.* I kinda miss that extra money I had to spend on the Samsung; it's not the cheapest netbook.Things I like about both:* One thing that drew me to the NC10 was the similarity of its keyboard layout to that of the Acer; I had found myself coming to like the little navigation section in the lower right, that puts page up and down keys near the arrow keys.  I had discarded some other NetBook options based on keyboard layout; I like to use PgUp/PgDn when reading, and having to hit a function key for them was unacceptable.  I still have to hit \"Fn\" to get Home and End, but I use them less often.  In contrast, the keyboard on a colleague's Dell Mini 9 felt very unnatural - not only cramped, but with many keys in nonstandard places.* Both fit really well on a cramped coach airline seat tray (the Acer a bit better, of course).  In contrast, my full size \"work\" laptop (a 15\" Thinkpad) is just about unusable.* Space!  I hate it when a computer's disk starts getting full and I have to worry about what to delete, so I never really considered the SSD-based netbooks.Things I don't like about both:* The vertical resolution (these are 1024x600) isn't enough for many web pages, particularly flash-based web pages for kids.  Pbskids.org and webkinz.com were a couple of the sites where the richly animated apps just didn't fit vertically.  If you're thinking about a netbook as a kid's computer, you might want to think  seriously about a more full-size laptop, and maybe try out their favorite sites in a smaller browser window.In conclusion: they're both great Netbooks, but the battery life and usability of the Samsung NC10 made it the best choice for me, despite the Aspire One's greater portability and lower cost.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Comparison with Acer Aspire One", "unixReviewTime": 1231200000, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2009"}

I watched the video demo at: //optechusa.com/Videos/SlingStrap.html  You can clearly see in the video the camera hangs by your hip area with the eye cup and back LCD screen rubbing against your pants/shirt.  When I have this hooked onto my Sony A99 and I walk around, my camera rubs back and forth against my clothes and I can imagine it will eventually destroy my eye cup and my back LCD screen due to friction.  I also tried to position my camera so that the part that rubs against my clothing is a not-as-delicate part of the camera but the only other position I can maneuver the camera into causes my clothing to rub against the top part of the camera where the second display plastic screen is on top.  All other positions feel unnatural when I walk and it naturally wants to twist back into the position that causes the eye cup and back LCD to rub against my clothes.  I have tried it with a Sony A99 and 85zeiss, 135zeiss, 28-70zeiss, 16-35zeiss, 24zeiss, and 50 1.4 all with the same results.  If you see this video of a Joby strap youtube.com/watch?v=76aS_cCL9UA it shows how the side of the camera rests against the clothing (the side of the camera is not as delicate as the eye cup, LCD screen, or top display on the Sony A99).  However, I am wary of using the Joby because I am afraid the tripod threads may come loose...anyways, back to the optech...so if you are one of those folks who really like to take care of their equipment, I would recommend a sling bag where the camera is fully protected in a bag that is slung around your shoulder...or a sling that attaches to the tripod thread if you are not afraid of it coming loose.

I love that this computer is so lightweight, because as a college student, it makes transporting it back and forth between my home and campus super convenient.2.) Everything is based around the Chrome web browser. I don't use much else on my PC besides going onto the internet, so this computer is perfect for me. I love all the apps that are offered through Google (such as Google Docs, Google Slides, etc.) because they're free, and almost identical to their PC counterparts. For example, Google Slides is so much easier to use over the 2007+ versions of Microsoft PowerPoint. Anyone can figure it out, and it's much better than OpenOffice as well. The best thing about this being internet based is Google Drive. You get it for 2 years free with the purchase of your laptop, and you never have to take your laptop with you if you prefer to leave it at home. I had a presentation due and just had to log into my Google account and pull it up on the school computer. This made my life so much simpler. And it automatically saves any changes that you make to your file, so if your computer were to crash, everything is backed up and you can access it from any other computer in your home.3.) Super fast boot speed. I don't know why anyone is complaining about having to wait for this thing to boot, because it is instant. I mean maybe a 5 second wait time if you let it die or power it down, and compared to a PC the boot time is 100000x faster.

It is still working like a charm after more than five years. I upgraded my system months ago. It seemed my new and sophisticated hdtv and AV system complicated the old usual setup, so I thought this dvd player was \"dead\"--it wasn't showing color. Remember this is the era of hdmi cables and not your cave-age three-color three-headed cables. The dvd player does not have hdmi; I kept trying composite connection but it didn't work. Anyway, I only recently returned to rethinking the connections--after nearly calling Geek to come and do it; bad reviews of Geek made me return to the task myself. I used a mixture of the optical connector and--yes--the tricolor cave-age cables. This arrangement worked beautifully, and with great sound from my over-achieving AV system. Just as an afterthought after the success, I tried to search if there is an update of the dvp player--still the modest 5-disc carousel but now with hdmi connections. Unfortunately, not available; only 400-disc players!! Too bad.

This fact, as well as the recent fire sale for this model, lead me to believe that this feature soon will be available only on professional camcorders. Apparently, persons younger than 45 (the average age of onset of presbyopia) and those who never go outdoors comprise the target demographics for manufacturers of consumer camcorders. This is the only plausible rationale for designing cameras that rely solely on an LCD screen for framing and focusing shots. Practically worthless in bright sunlight, the challenge of using them, indoors or out, is revealed by the number of users who must hold their cameras at arm's length in an effort to frame a shot. So, in spite of being very satisfied with the image and build quality of the Canon Vixia HF200 that I formerly owned, my frustration with the lack of a viewfinder forced me to sell it and buy the M41.The body of the M41 appears to be made of black plastic. Perhaps it will prove to be very sturdy, but it does not make as positive an impression as the finish of the HF200.  Another difference is the use of a touch screen for making shooting adjustments on the M41 rather than the tiny joy stick device on the HF200. I have found the touch screen to work effectively and prefer it to the micro-mechanical approach (both cameras also use membrane switches located on the body of the camera). I must admit that I have some apprehensions about the long-term durability of a touch screen for this application, but they seem to hold up on smartphones and I won't be using the camcorder nearly as often as I use my smartphone. I made one other concession by accepting the 10x optical zoom lens on the M41 in contrast to the 15x lens on the HF200; however, this is consistent with a general downgrade in this feature across manufacturers (offset, perhaps, by improved digital zooming that is accomplished by software rather than optics).The quality of the videos I've shot with the M41 seems as good as those I took with the HF200; however, consistent with my intentions in purchasing this camera, the framing and tracking of subjects is much improved because of the viewfinder. Having achieved this fundamental objective, I am willing to take a chance that the plastic body and touchscreen may not hold up under appropriately careful use.Until very recently, the price of this camera was typically well above $600. In early November, Canon reduced the price of its direct sales to $499 and apparently offered a $200 rebate to retailers so that they would fall in line on pricing. I purchased it from Amazon for $449, a price that seemed to be available for only a day or two.  Given the quality of the technology on which it is built (see other reviews and the product information from Canon), I feel that it was a very good value. The current pricing gives the impression of a close-out on this model.  I would be surprised to learn that it is being replaced with a better model that includes a viewfinder. Instead, as I noted above, I expect that the M41 may be the last consumer camcorder that features a viewfinder.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A camcorder alternative for presbyopic videographers and those who shoot video outdoors", "unixReviewTime": 1321056000, "reviewTime": "11 12, 2011"}

It's similar to IS on Canon's lenses.It helps achieve keeper shots at low light and it's great for video as well. The lens does get a littlesoft in the corners but thats only really noticeable if you zoom 400x or something crazy like that.As for the build it's like a tank, nice weight to it and the elements used are of the highest quality. I likethe front element the most because usually you find a curved glass but this has a flat element making it almostlook like it has a pre-builtin filter. One downside is the filter size is 82mm so if you plan on getting this lens realizeyou're going to have to get new filters if you dont already. 82mm isnt common so I had to get a whole new setfor this lens. Another downside I find irritanting is the focus and zoom rings are reversed of Canon's, I know it's not thatbig of a deal but that's like saying \"ok here's a new car, brake is on the right and gas is on the left.\"Not too mention the focus ring is so tiny compared to the large zoom ring. And one more oddity is I dont know if these lens' are really rated at what their real coverage area is. I took a shot with a 50mm f/1.4 and took a shot with Tamron at 50mm. In comparison to the prime lens it was slightly off by Id say 3-5mm or so? If thats the case then maybe the 24mm might even be a little wider ( which for me isnt a bad thing at all ).

Apparently, that rule does not apply here. Sneaky marketing?I also own the X-230 and I was very impressed with it, considering they're 2.1 speakers. The X-230 actually feels like surround sound. However, I can't say the same about the X-240's. The X-240 just sounds like what one would usually expect from 2.1 speakers.The X-230 has two drivers in each speaker (total of four), whereas this new version, X-240, only contains one; that may be why it sounds more flat.The X-240 sounds like I'm just listening from a regular jukebox. It doesn't sound terrible, but it just doesn't have that rich dynamic feel and sounds a bit muffled.The X-230 bass is pretty overpowering even at the lowest setting; maybe because of those complaints, Logitech decided to make the X-240 rely more on treble and tried to go for clarity. Unfortunately, the result ended up sounding more flat. I guess Logitech tried to cut back costs by using only one driver for each speaker. Bad idea.Speaking of cheap... honestly, the dock is very cheap. Basically, you slide it out -- and it doesn't even come out that far -- where you place one of the plastic \"adapters\" (included for the iPod, Zune, etc...).  I tried to set it up, so I could place the iPod sync cable and place my iPod Classic, but that was a mess. The cable would not hold in place firmly at all; and without connecting to it, there wouldn't be anything secure to hold the mp3 player. The \"dock\" (if you can even call it that) is just unreliable and worthless for me. There's really no weight to the \"dock\", so it would easily knock over. It is basically a HUGE volume remote. The volume control is also on the side of the dock, and the dial, again, feels cheap. The speaker dial for the X-230 is located nicely on the speaker and the design/feel is so much better.Bad ergonomics: The X-230 cradle (huge remote) is also hard wired together to the subwoofer, so that makes it very difficult setting it up on the desk.Everything--ergonomics, design, sound--the previous model, X-230, wins against the X-240. I was looking forward for the added \"dock\" feature, but that is truly a gimmick. It was definitely an afterthought.I own many Logitech products, and I've been impressed with most of them, but this one was disappointing. The sound difference is quite significant. If you have a choice between the two, I would definitely go for the X-230, even if it costs a little extra. No question.If you absolutely can't stand bass, then the X-240 may be for you--but you will also be sacrificing a more dynamic surround sound because of less speaker drivers.In the end, these are just \"Okay\" speakers.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A Downgrade?

Let me start by saying that someones review sighted that the extended pinky grip with rest could cause the mouse to tip.  This is absolutely false, in fact the added rest has a slide pad on it making the mouse more stable and actualy less likely to tip.  Secondly in the same review he/she said that with the same pinky grip that the mouse is impossible to pick up during normal mouse usage.  This is also false.  The angles of the mouse make it quite easy to pick up and reset.  Also in this review the reviewer stated that with the palm rest fully extended there was an uncomfortable gap.  This is blatantly false as your hand would have to actualy curve backward at your palm to produce any sort of discomfort.  All of this leads me to believe that he/she never bought the product but simply made observations while looking at pictures.  Lastly he /she stated that the precision button could not be remapped and let me tell you that it can and it is incredibly easy to do so.  Now for my review.I bought this mouse mainly for use with photoshop and gaming.  Out of the box this mouse is amazing.  The reciver plugs in via USB as you would expect but is a combination reciever, battery charger and storage for your weights.  The grip, texture and overall design of the mouse are stunning and functional.  The sensitivity of the mouse adjusts with a quick touch of a rocker switch and the precision aim button slows the mouse to a crawl to get that perfect headshot or precision pixel selection in photoshop.  I wish the weel had a free spin mode like my old mouse but this is a very minor complaint.I have very large hands and like a mouse with decent heft so a mouse that scales and customizes to my grip was atractive.  A small mouse gives me painful hand and wrist cramps and most mice are made for people with average to small hands.  It took only about five minutes or so of playing with this mouse, adjusting it and swapping grips to turn it into the most comfortable mouse I have ever owned.  I had a first gen M Revolution X and I cant belive that this mouse actualy fits my hand better.The next thing I did was download the photoshop profiles.  Figuring out how exactly to install said profiles from the website was a bit bewildering but it didnt take too long to figure it out.

The side scroll can even be set up to increase and decrease brush size.Then I downloaded profiles for my favorite games.  I minutes I had this mouse performing beautifuly with all of my favorite games.  The only downside to this mouse is that it does not automaticaly detect active programs and switch profiles forcing you to manualy switch.  In some ways however this is a benefit as with many of these auto detect softwares there are frequent problems with games or programs not being detected properly (a constant problem with my old logitech mouse).  This takes out any chance of error.

It seems as if it pushes out the CD and if you just tap it, *pop* it comes out. Minor issue. Also, since the battery does not run across the entire bottom of the laptop, it may make it a bit wobbly when it's on a flat surface. Another minor gripe.Verdict: An awesome upgrade!

The Nexus 10 case is of the same excellent quality as the Nexus 7 case.  The red is perhaps a bit more pinkish than the pictures show (on second thought, maybe not).  It is also a bit more feminine than I would like.  The Nexus 10 snaps in very firmly.  There is no chance of it falling out.  The case is not overly bulky, but it does take away from the svelte style of the naked frame. Also, you trade the velvety smooth back for a felt feel. Like many extended batteries on smartphones (I'm thinking of the SIII), this case makes the tablet a bit easier to hold.  Before the Nexus 10, I used the Galaxy Tab 10.1 with a Samsung made case.  The Poetic case is perhaps a bit thicker, and the triangle-fold cover flops in a way that I'm not used to - the Samsung case was a flat stiff cover.  It would have been easy for Poetic to put magnets in the back of the plastic case, so that the cover would stay attached to the back - this would be a huge improvement.  The triangle stand works very well when in two modes: 1) the low profile mode (screen at a 30 degree angle), and 2) the stand up mode (screen at a 60 degree angle).  However, it won't keep the Nexus vertical if you are laying in bed watching Netflix (as the OEM Samsung case did), nor will it hold the 60 degree angle on your lap (as the Samsung case did).  The sleep/wake function is flawless, and was well worth the wait.The reason I didn't give the case 5 stars has to do with my suspicions about its build quality. The plastic case seems solid - it would last a fall down hardwood stairs, protecting the Nexus very well, especially if the magnet cover holds. I have my doubts that the faux leather material will wear as well. I suspect the major joint will fray over time. The flap, however, is designed to hang on the bottom of the Nexus 10; this way it doesn't interfere with the camera. All of the cutaways have ample room, except the volume rocker, which you kinda have to sneak in on from the back (I have to use my nail to adjust the volume as opposed to the pad of my finger).The one feature that is not like the pictures is the logo.  The empty \"Poetic\" logo is filled with a silver reflective coating.  I would have preferred that this stayed empty.

Just know that this device does NOT improve the picture quality, and does not add the 2 settings that they removed in March 2012. I know many owners were hoping that this kit will improve the picture quality, and some were even told it will  last year before they bought their TVs. Samsung even made a video last year and played it at the 2012 CES show, which is also on YouTube, which states \"improved picture quality\" but I think they were referring to the \"Smart hub\". If you use the smart hub, and apps, then maybe you will benefit from this and be happy with it.Since Samsung removed the \"Shadow detail\" setting, which may be the same as the \"Smart LED\" setting found on the F8000 that controls the dimming, I was hoping they would at least add this setting back to the TVs with this kit. Since they removed the settings from a \"Firmware\" update, then they can easily add them back the same way, but this never happened. This is why I'm so upset with them. Many consumers who purchased the 2012 ES8000, aren't even aware that these settings were removed, because they were removed from the \"ES8000\" when it had its very first FW updateMay 10, 2013  (ORIGINAL REVIEW)I do not own this. I'm writing this to let others know what this kit is \"supposedly\" going to do. Last year they promoted this kit as it \"Will\" improve your picture quality, and it \"Will\" bring it to the next years specs. It was \"Never\" called the \"Smart\" Evo kit, until just recently. It was called \"the Evolution Kit\" now it's called, \"Smart Evolution Kit\" and also, there are reports saying that this kit will \"NOT\" improve the picture quality. So all these people who saw these TVs in 2012 as being an \"upgradable\" TV every year, that will \"improve\" the picture quality, may be very dissapointed. I know a lot of people bought these 2012 models, because of this Marketing, and IMO, it seems like it was done so consumers like us \"owners\", bought \"their\" models, and not another brand like a Sony, LG, or Panny.  And now, here we are a year later, and now everything is different. Even the name is a little different, along with this ridiculous price. You can buy a Blu ray player for this' price. You can even buy a blu ray player that has this new smart hub 2.0. why should anyone pay over $300 if it isn't going to improve the picture quality like we were all told before we bought these TVs?I mean, $400 or even $300, for things that can be done through a Firmware update? of course adding a \"Quad core\" processor can't,  be added through FW, since its hardware, but, why can't they send everyone the new Smart Hub 2.0  through one of their \"Mysterious\" FW updates? People can buy a Blu ray player for less then this, and get way more for their money. $400-$300 is a \"rip off\" for this. You can buy 3 Apple TVs, which IMO, run way faster and smoother then their Smart Hubs 1 and 2.0. Even with their \"So called\" quad core processor. with The new Sony Playstation and XBox coming, I would save your money for that, then waste it on this. The web browsers on the 2013 F8000 with the quad core processors, are still slow. Just like the 2012 ES were with the \"Dual core\".Now, I also want to let all you 2012 Owners of the \"ES7500\" and \"ES8000\" know that 2 picture settings were removed after its very first Firmware update in March 2012. The picture settings were, \"Shadow Detail\" and \"Edge Enhancer\"Last time i looked up the description for \"Shadow detail\", it had a very similar description as the \"Smart LED\" settings that Samsung left on the ridiculously \"over priced\" 75\" ES9000.  They also have this setting on their new F8000 series, which actually cost less then what I paid for my ES8000 in March 2012. You would think the ES8000 would of been \"Cheaper\" since they are making the new F8000 sound like its \"way\" superior this year, and so \"different\", but it actually cost less for the F8000 compared to March 2012 when the ES8000 came out. Just to give an example, i paid $2,700 for the 46\" ES8000 in March 2012 LOL! and, it had these 2 picture settings at that time. LOL!Then, theirs a setting called \"Cinema Black\" thats on the 2013 models. This setting seems to be the \"SAME\" setting as the \"Black Enhancer\" that's on the ES8000, only difference is, the name change, and its only available to use with \"movie\" mode. Not standard mode like the 2013 F8000 have. All that takes is a FW release where they can enable it for standard mode and give us the setting to control it. Also, The folks in the UK had their \"Black Enhancer\" setting and another removed from them last March 2012 from a Firmware update as well, leaving them to be forced to use only the \"Standard\" setting because the clouding, and flash-lighting (Edge Bleed)  is totally masked in Standard mode.I guess we in the \"US\" got lucky, because we could use \"Movie\" mode because we still have the \"Black Enhancer\" \"aka \"Cinema Black\"  as an option for Movie mode..It looks like some where after CES \"January\" 2012, they decided to turn the 75\" ES8000 into a 75\" ES9000 and charge $10K, and make the ES8000 look like its a \"lower\" end model. IMHO, they removed these settings from us \"owners\" of the ES8000, just so they can market the 75\" ES9000, as being a totally different TV to make it look like its worth the $10K it was charging for it last year, when really they both probably have the same exact hardware in them, and the only difference is the Software. If we still had the \"Shadow Detail\" which IMO, is basically the \"Smart LED\" setting, then we wouldn't have that constant dimming they call \"Ce\" dimming, when using the Standard mode. also, the owners in the UK, wouldn't have so much clouding, and Edge bleeding.So Samsung, I'm curious why the folks in Canada who own the F8000 don't have the \"Smart LED\" setting? Or the folks in the UK?  Also, do we have to spend $300+ for this Evo Kit in order to get those 2 settings back that you removed from us, after we already owned the TV?And what's up with your Firmware updates? I've had 2 or 3 of my TVs get pretty messed up after it had a FW update. One TV got so bad, it had to be replaced. Ive also seen the picture quality go up and down, up and down, all year long. I never heard of FW updates making things go backwards. Usually, they are to fix bugs, not take steps backwards, and Not change the picture quality so much. Also, It looks like the plasmas and LEDs are the same Firmware. How can a plasma have the same Software/Firmware as an LED? Wouldn't that destroy the plasma over time? I heard that a lot of consumers plasmas \"Screens\" cracked last year due to heat, and I wouldn't be surprised if this is happening if they are both on the same Firmware. Is this how you made the 2013 F8500 so bright? I think its strange that you have some FW updates go straight to the TVs, and other updates available for download on your site.And, What's up with all these Firmware updates? I heard Sony, Panasonic, and LG's TVs don't get so many Firmware updates as these do. I mean, my 2012 TVs, have had more FW updates then my 2009 iMac. What's up with that Mr. Samsung? Please! I've been waiting for answers about these settings being wiped out of my TVs and others for a year now. Can you please Add them back? We shouldn't have to spend $300 to get them back either. They can be added through a FW update the same way they were removed.I read about you guys losing at court for that class action lawsuit for using those \"50 cent \" capacitors in your $3k and $4k TVs. Was that done so people will have to buy a new TV every couple of years?  Is this $300 Evo kit being done now, because of that lawsuit? I'm starting to wonder, because I thought I read that the reason those \"faulty\" capacitors were being used, was so people will have to buy a new TV every couple years, and you guys can continue to keep selling so many TVs. Where as, if you used \"reliable\" better quality capacitors, then people wouldn't need to buy a new TV for years, but you wouldn't sell so many TVs either and make any profits.. But,  It seems like you found the perfect replacement though with this $300 Evo Kit every year. Congratulations Samsung! You sure are the BEST at marketing. I read an article recently that said you spent 14 Million on marketing your 2013 Smart TVs! Wow! Mr. Samsung! That's a lot of money spent just to \"Market\" your 2013 Smart TVs. I was hoping to read that 14 million went to your quality control, since IMO, there are just way too many consumers buying These TVs, and having dead pixels, banding, and needing \"Main Boards\" replaced, and needing to go through like 3 or 4 TVs, before they get a decent one. I'm very disappointed Mr. Samsung, and I hope you can answer some of these concerns I have, cause they are the same concerns[...] It looks like they are trying to have this important info buried so no one reads it, by hitting the \"unhelpful\" tab. [...] Just trying to help other consumers that spent $$$$$ on these over priced TVs last year. Thanks :- ).

I have no agenda in posting this just wanted others to have a chance to consider the Yamaha as likely one of the most under celebrated integrated amplifiers of my multi-decade hobby.My original review is below. After several hours of listening, I identified a faulty lamp which was not illuminating. Instead of requesting a return I simply returned it as the sound seemed a little harsh on the upper midrange lower treble. Maybe it simply featured other weaknesses in my system but in the end it resulted in noteworthy listening fatigue. I'm now seeking a little warmer integrated amp to replace several components and a lot of wiring clutter.This unit replaced an Adcom GTP-400 from circa 1990 as I desired subwoofer outputs which the Adcom was lacking. The sound, build quality and feature set of this preamp are tremendous. Thanks Emotiva for building audiophile quality at an affordable price point.

It took mere minutes, and my i7 Windows 7 Dell Studio XPS had this thing configured very quickly and painlessly.  One thing to remember is that you have to get into the sound setup in the Control Panel to ensure that the Bose is the default system, it does not happen automatically.  The cords provided are long enough to allow for slack and easy hook-up.Second, I gotta say that the aesthetics are fantastic.  This system takes up less room and looks great.  The bass module, however, needs some real estate underneath the desk (not in terms of height or width, but in length, it is 17\" long).  The graphite and silver finish is also pleasing in terms of looks and contrast.Third, the integrated volume/input pod is great, easy to use, and unobtrusive.  It allows for easy connection of another source (2 channel), headphones, and when it is tapped on the top automatically goes into mute mode, another tap and it goes live again.Finally, let me tell you about the sound.....it SUCKED!  I couldn't believe it, after spending a premium amount of money and getting a system that sounded tinny and muddy, so tinny that it hurt my ears to listen.I read the manual, look online, and was almost ready to pack them up.

Fantastic treble and tight bass, with a good overlap of midrange from the satellites.Now I show these off to my friends and family and they are blown away.  But this was an accidental discovery.

When these arrived, of course the older kid liked the looks better (has animal figures and the Kidz Gear are not that cutesy) and even tried to tell me hers were broken! :)I wanted to try a different brand since I always thought the Kidz Gear sounded terrible (very muffled, like you were listening with cotton stuck in your ears)So these arrive, and yes they are cute.  They also seem to be a little sturdier (although that has not been a problem to date with the Kidz Gear as they are still working after many intl/overnight flights) and maybe almost TOO inflexible in some parts, as the fit doesn't seem to be as good as the Kidz Gear, which conform a little better to the shape of the head.So back to the sound quality:  I am not trying to raise audiophiles, but on the other hand, why submit very low fidelity sound to your kids, especially given that many of the songs they are hearing for the first time?  Also knowing that it's certainly possible to produce a headphone that sounds 2x better than these at the same cost.  The earbuds that came with several phones and mp3 players as freebies sound MUCH better than both of these phones.So, yes I am being picky, and I do realize that most parents just don't care about sound quality themselves in many cases, much less for the kids, but I am not one of those parents.  Would you want to buy glasses for your kids that are hazy and unclear?Anyway, I give three stars PRIMARILY based on sound quality, which is poor, at best.

I tried it for a few days but it wasn't anything like I expected.  First of all, I realized immediately that even with a high quality notebook screen, glare was going to be a problem in a car.  Also, having to use a mouse and keyboard to enter data over to your side requires you to be stopped when using it for safety reasons.  But that's not Garmin's fault.  But where the Garmin really fell down was in things that it shouldn't have a problem with.1. Accuracy.  Inconsistent.  The maps were ok and even had many new roads in my area, but when I typed in an address and started following directions, they were just plain wrong.  In one trip to an apartment that was even listed on their map itself, the unit kept trying to make me do a U turn half a mile before I reached the actual apartment.  This would drive someone crazy if they were not familiar with the place's location already.  Input a street address and sometimes it would be incorrect on the map.  I knew the area well and otherwise it would have been a very frustrating trip to find the address.2.  Data input.  When trying to type in a new address to find, it would not recognize the proper spelling of many roads, and I would have to play games to \"trick\" the unit into accepting an address.  Gate parkway N had to be inputted as N gate pkwy, or Touchton Road had to be put in as E Touchton Road, when it is not called that on street signs or anywhere else.  Time consuming.3.  Interface:  I also found it less than intuitive to simply plot a trip, even w/o waypoints.  It was a little less easy to use than some of the portable units I've seen demo tapes of.4.  Directions:  I tried to plan a trip to Tampa and was given a route that I knew to be longer and more difficult than just using the interstates.  I guess because it was shorter in miles.  I changed the preferences to weigh towards the interstates, but then it took me on loops around the perimeter here that made no sense.  In another instance it had me drive by a place, avoid u-turning to get into it, then drive 5 miles in a loop around town to come back to it.  But clicking off \"avoid u turns\" fixed that.  The problem is, it then had me U-turning at every chance possible.5.  points of interest.  Pretty good, including some very obscure places here.  But also many obvious ones were simply missing.  I'm not sure how one gets his restaurant or store  added to their maps, but when they don't include them all, you lose faith in the machine.  It's better than nothing, but not good enough to rely on.My conclusion is that no computer navigator is going to be as good as a human brain with a map.  So for that reason the routing feature of these devices is not very useful to me.  But, I could use a nice color moving map which advised me of upcoming street names, sort of a driving \"assistant\".  And for that, they'd do fine.  However, using gps with your laptop isn't a great idea in practice unless you have a fancy setup to point it at yourself and hold it firmly in place, and the space to do so, like in a pickup truck.  You need to be able to see the screen and you can't keep looking to your side to check it.I would advise getting an inexpensive portable unit you can attach in your line of site, entering the destination, using it to get into the general area, then figuring out how to get to the place itself on your own and just use the map as an aide to that.  It is very helpful to see a graphical display of the upcoming roads.  Units that name the roads for you are much more helpful but cost a lot more.I would NEVER trust these type of units to put me in the proper lane for an exit at high speed on the interstates.  They require too much of your attention and what you gain from them you use in awareness of what's going on outside.I also was concerned over having my expensive notebook computer in the car all the time, more prone to damage or theft, than otherwise.The unit was great at finding a signal, even indoors it did ok.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "disappointing", "unixReviewTime": 1137456000, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2006"}

Really? With F1.4 lens, I would give a rat's rear end for the sensor size... It gives perfect results and that counts for me the most.3-Slow zoom in/out... Ok, go somewhere else then. It sure is slow and I am not making an Oscar winning movie with it... so I don't really care. Again, fast... I mean FAST focusing just makes up that \"slow\" zooming!!!4-No viewfinder! Sold separately... I confess, I tried to get closer to this camera a few times, thinking there is one... and little weird to take photos looking at the LCD screen, but not a big deal!5-Only 24-90mm zoom!

It has a lot of room to improve but remains the best product in its class. I am, however, very disappointed about two specific issues. First is the outrageously expensive DLC. Based on this pricing I have no plans on ever buying any of the extra available songs, turning this into a somewhat dead-end experience. This ultimately limits the game because it comes with such a small number of songs to learn, and most of them are terribly annoying. So if you are a customer without hundreds of extra dollars to spend on songs after buying Rocksmith, you may want to avoid this product. The problem is so severe that 3rd party websites have popped up allowing Rocksmith 2014 users to take control of the DLC situation. Good job Ubisoft--I now need a 3rd party site?! The second major problem with Rocksmith 2014 is the developer's completely ignoring existing guitar education methods while attempting to re-invent the wheel. I can appreciate giving gamers a GUI that will ween them off Guitar Hero but Rocksmith 2014 has no traditional music staves or guitar tablature. Instead they've invented 3D music blocks that fly at you and have weird shapes. This leaves players without the foundation they will need to go out into the real world as musicians.So, about playing the game. All things considered this is still a great product. First a few big impressions: I am learning lead guitar fast with this thing, there are (Windows) bugs, Ubisoft site / Uplay is a fail, and I do feel the pain many are experiencing with installation, though I am personally a tech-wiz who loves Steam and navigated the install without a hitch. I sold my old Peavey and I'm now playing a new Epiphone SG Special in honor of this great event. While Steam proudly displays my 90+ hours invented into Rocksmith, it seems the Ubisoft Uplay system has failed to recognize much of my progress. So, the 60-day challenge, which I entered just for fun, isn't properly being tracked. According to Uplay the last time I played the game was on the 18th even though I've been playing daily. So, although I was going to remove a star for the above mentioned issues, I'm leaving at five due to my overall impression. History will be looking back fondly upon this one.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I am extremely impressed with Rocksmith 2014 here on my Asus laptop running Windows 8.1. This is an addictive experience that has left my fingertips tingling and my mind racing with new guitar ideas. I do have some minimal guitar skills but my main background is drumming, and I've never played any other guitar games (such as Guitar Hero). Other reviewers with heavy guitar background might paint a more complete picture, but from my perspective as a gamer and electric guitar noob Ubisoft has a monster on their hands!This Cable-bundled package has a very special cable. I've been waiting my whole life for something like this to exist. While I am using a really messed up old guitar, the idea of $200 package with a ready-to-use guitar is beyond my belief right now. I cannot think of a hotter holiday item--ever. It really works! The computer recognizes what you play while helping with calibration and tuning. This system allows people like me to learn and round out areas of musical weakness, such as all the scales I've been so lazy about. The way the product teaches, analyses, and suggests the next step is tear-jerking for a technology and music fanatic like myself. I can see a new generation of musicians fueled by this technology, unlike the plastic guitar tradition that came before it. Ubisoft did a lot of work to bring this evolved system together, and I cannot even comment on the prior version. I can say this version is really amazing.Buying this retail box unlocks your Steam key -- Steam being the digital distribution system the game is founded upon. Ubisoft also runs their own client in the background which requires its own login; thankfully it does not get in the way, but does require its own one-time account setup. Steam then remains the portal through which all additional song purchases are made. These song \"lessons\" contain what appear to be extremely detailed training packages, showing riffs, licks, tricks, rhythm, and bass for each song. They've done some homework. The songs that come with the package are quite impressive. Watching \"lead\" parts at 100% challenge level reveals how much work has gone into this. I really look forward to mastering these licks.Since the plastic Rockband days I really was reminded this would one day become a reality. It has, and then some. The retro-style mini-games, lessons, session modes, and overall attention-grabbing content makes this a very compelling product.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Decent Game And Somewhat Helpful For Guitar Education", "unixReviewTime": 1385856000, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2013"}

Initially, I tried them at home in a quiet environment and was extremely disappointed. The sound was muted, with muddy bass and unclear high frequencies.  I just left music play on them for a few hours to \"break-in\" the headphones, then started using them on flights. To my surprise, in actual noisy environments, these are superb noise canceling headphones. The bass is good, there's a little too much emphasis on the midtones (presumably due to the Linx technology), and the high notes are okay.  These headphones work much better in a steady noise environment, where listening conditions are far from ideal.  They will not replace headphones designed for a quiet environment though, but are acceptable for that purpose.  In terms of noise canceling, the NC200W appears to cut out about 85-90% of ambient noise.  With music playing, it is nearly impossible to hear pilot/flight attendant announcements. Build quality is good. I have had no issues with folding or adjustments. Based on Amazon reviews, the white color model appears to be more durable than the black color version. Another thing to note is that the headphones come with a soft bag for storage, and it has a very useful long drawstring. The drawstring allows the user to place the bag over the head, so you don't lose the bag or leave it behind, plus you don't have to bury the headphones or dig them out of a carry-on bag in the airplane aisle while boarding, because you can just wear the bag. I've used other noise canceling headphones over the last 15 years, and these are superior to noise isolation earbuds which don't have active cancellation and don't have as strong a bass response. These are the equals or betters of headphones that are/were three times the price, making them a great value, as I've paid $200-300 for older sets from other manufacturers that didn't cancel noise as well. Thus, if you can live with the limitation that these aren't quiet environment headphones, I would highly recommend them to you.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great value, great performance", "unixReviewTime": 1328313600, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2012"}

The range is pretty great. 2k sq ft. apartment and 5 bars using 2.4GHz N and G mode. 4-5 bars using 5Ghz N mode with great speeds - the closer the better of course, when it comes to 5Ghz. Simultaneous band use means that I can use one mode for G and N and the other for N - being able to use both bands at the same time is truly a great thing at this point in time, as I have many G devices that would pull down my N speeds if I had to use mixed mode.There has been a firmware update as of late 2010 which claims to fix some of the issues but I haven't tested it. I'd decided that I would either sell the box or run alternative firmware, and so I picked running the firmware which worked nicely for me.In the end, I cannot recommend the router as it is. However, with some tweaks and/or alternative firmware this is a great router and I would wholeheartedly recommend it.Pros:Good hardwareInformative lightsGreat featuresEasy to setup and useCons:Terrible 'initial' firmware (2009)Must disable some of the very features which make the router attractive for it to actually workRequires too many front end tweaks to work, this is typical of a low/mid brand router - not a top brandRemember, if you use one of these or purchase one recently and it comes with the B0 firmware simply disable Home Defender and Upnp to get yours to work as it should.You should also attempt to update the firmware if you can, as that MAY fix some of these issues.If you are somewhat tech savvy, consider applying DDWRT firmware to really unlock the power of this device.

It was extremely easy to set up, and within minutes I had TV on my Mac.  The TV feed is buffered, so (just like a DVR/Tivo), you can watch live TV and skip commercials. You can set the viewing window size from small (put it in a corner and watch while you work) to full screen (forget work, just goof off!)Scheduling recordings is very easy due to a link to a service (Titan) that maintains current TV schedules. You can schedule shows to be recorded from anywhere you have an Internet connection by signing in to your Titan account (free).  Your scheduling choices will be transferred to your Mac if it is connected to the Internet.  You can even have the recording software wake your computer, or even start it (if you allow auto log-in), when it's time to record.  There is a basic video editor, helpful for removing commercials from your recorded material.  You can also take screen shots.Multiple export options are available, and while I haven't tried them all, I did try exporting to a QuickTime Movie format.  It may be that the G4 processor is too slow, but the conversion took...3 DAYS.  I tried exporting to MPEG and the same thing.  Toast software is included for burning to DVDs, but I don't have a DVD burner to test that.  A remote control is included, although I sit at my Mac, so I don't need it.Bottom line: I love this device/software combo and think it's a good value.Why 4 instead of 5 stars?

It is easy to change the names of the network ids as well as other technical stuff as needed.  But the router is basically ready to go out of the box.This router is feature rich with things like network printing, sharing a USB storage device on a home network, and performance monitoring software.  But the two features that I like the most have to do with smartphones.  The Netgear Genie software has the ability to enable AirPrint, which allows for direct printing from an iPhone to a Windows-based printer, whether the printer is USB or network connected.  I can now print an email or a PDF file directly from my smartphone to an old USB-connected HP printer that is attached to a Windows-based laptop.The second feature that is pretty neat is that the Netgear Genie software is also available as downloadable app.  This puts network monitoring capability of a home network onto a handheld smartphone.  This makes for a handy diagnostic tool.This router is nicely engineered inside and out.  On the outside, the casing is a glossy black and shiny tower that stands at a slight tilt.  As a result, it has an aesthetically-looking modern look to it.This router is comfortably running three laptops, two iPhones and a Roku box.

Left my favorite Sennheiser microphone at the office (*Duh*), so I had to use my old Andrea stand-by 'mike,' but....Dragon literally flies on MacBook Pro. Installation was slick.  Everything worked as planned. I dictated normally, and DNS was very accurate. Then I started dictating faster, with longer, more complicated paragraphs, and it did very well -- in fact, extremely well (this is just with the quick ten-minute training session and without allowing DNS to scour my emails/documents to learn my style). Ok, so it missed 'egregious' and gave me 'courageous' -- so big whoop. My wife was amazed at how accurate and fast it was. Even my son, the technogeek, was impressed -- and nothing I do in his tech-savvy life impresses him. Actually, the MacBook was more his idea than mine -- we just decided to try it with DNS for the heck of it.I have been using Dragon for years, and I currently run it on a Thinkpad Centrino and a dual core Intel PC, and I can honestly say Dragon on the MacBook runs better, faster and more accurately than it does on either of my other machines -- and I was getting good results with them. I have to say I was very skeptical that the MacBook would come close to my other machines, but I was wrong. I realize my testing is subjective without hard, empirical data to back up my claims, but I don't care -- I'm going with the MacBook for now b/c I have a feeling it's going to save me a lot of time, blood, sweat and tears.The MacBook is an extremely sexy machine, and it has so many cool features on the Mac side that Windows simply can't match. I know we MS junkies are all waiting for Vista to salvage Windows (and Bill's $$$ advantage over Warren), but IMHO it's simply going to be a quasi knock-off of OSX. By then, Apple's OS will be even further ahead.

{"reviewerID": "AE0LPTNSDSDMB", "asin": "B000V4PZCI", "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer \"richlife\"", "helpful": [12, 14], "reviewText": "First and foremost, this is a truly great GPS.  Second, you MUST upgrade the firmware to the current level -- makes it perform at peak level.  (Also, if you're a AAA member, upgrade the AAA Tourbook data and get your free, members only warranty extension -- see [...]).  Third, make your own assessment, don't put too much faith in the negative reviews -- I frankly question the honesty in some of them.I've only had my 4250 for a few days, but both my wife and I agree that it's an incredible device. Read the previous review by BrandonNM, \"Jeff\" and see that I agree completely with his comments.  But also notice that many of the cons are being addressed by Magellan with the new 4350 and 4370 to be released in July 08.  I read many, many reviews and user comments in trying to decide whether to buy the Maestro 4250, wait for the new one or go with the Garmin 760.  I'm glad I chose the 4250 and can happily wait a couple of years to get a newer Magellan replacement.If you have or buy the 4250, be sure to tap on every icon and every info box to see what it will display.  The manual is definitely too brief (that's a minor negative) and doesn't show all the options (and that's a major plus -- there's more here than meets the eye).  An example, tap on the \"Arrival time\" box when you're in a route, it changes to remaining time and remaining miles before going back to arrival time.  It seems everything has buried options underneath.I read many reviews and user comments.  Some are clearly biased, others I wonder how they got a unit that was bad.  Mostly I just don't accept the negatives I read.  Except for not having enough time to see if it will break down, I've exhaustively checked every option more than once.  Most complaints about the 4250 not doing this or that are because the reviewer or user didn't take the time to find the proper path or method.  Another example -- a major review that said you can't change a planned route once it is entered.  I planned a route for my current 1000-mile round trip.  I then Optimized and Saved it.  I went back and added a new stop (Append) and re-optimized.  I went back and deleted one of the stops and re-optimized.  All went perfectly.  It even found for me a shoe store in a huge shopping center -- the shopping center wasn't mapped, but the shoe store was pinpointed on my GPS and it told me I was there when I got to within 50 feet.The new firmware definitely improves responsiveness and re-routing if you make a wrong turn.  For example, a new stretch of highway was put in where the older instructions said to turn.  Before I was 100 feet on the new road, I heard the \"calculating route\" message and a corrected route taking me in from the opposite side was displayed.  Fantastic!  And that happened more than once!  (Lots of new roads on this trip.)  The map is the same NavTec map in use by all current GPSs -- an update is expected this Fall and hopefully that will resolve some of these.  I had no problems finding any of the POIs we chose -- that will certainly be hit and miss as on any GPS as places change over time.  But the AAA data was accurate and up-to-date to the last quarter.  We have been AAA members for many years and have always relied on the AAA tourbooks, getting new ones for every trip.  Now we don't have to get the newest annual book unless we want it -- the most recent updates can be downloaded every quarter to the 4250.We haven't yet tested the Bluetooth, but our phone is supposed to be compatible.  At this point using Bluetooth is problematic between any two devices, so it's just not a big issue for us.One thing I want to point out, is that Magellan appears to be addressing many concerns with the 4250 (the 2007 high end model) both with firmware updates and corrections in the manufacturing stream (later purchases don't have the same issues are the earliest ones).  They are also making changes is the 2008 line (4350, 4370, etc.) to address concerns like not being able to enter addresses with voice commands (the 4350 will have that as well as a \"pedestrian\" mode.Some more good things:  The touch screen is quite sensitive and almost always responds to a tap.  Occasionally, it will miss (just re-tap) or will pick up a double-tap (oops, go back) minor stuff.  The screen brightness is great, but definitely bright at night.  Volume and brightness can be adjusted with the Options menu and there you also can see your battery level.  The volume is orginally set to High -- too loud for our relatively quiet Camry, but that's fine with loud music.  We found no problems at all with the Magellan responding to our voice commands.  Normal tone of voice, picks up my low voice and my wife's higher voice with no problem at all.  I actually like the window mount.  Set it up properly, and it easly turns from side to side (driver to passenger) while staying in place for finger taps and remaining level to both views.I also had to contact Magellan Tech Support because of a difficulty signing up for the 2nd year warranty (it never told me it worked).  I got a response within 24 hours confirming my extended warranty.If we have any problems over time, I'll post here.  We are extremely happy with our purchase.  If you don't like some of the current concerns (no voice address input, 2007 map, etc.) wait for the new releases and pay a few hundred dollars more.  Or do like we decided -- get a great GPS and plan to upgrade in a couple of years when it's a lot better.

Anyone else who plays mmo's know that large guilds communicate through voice chat programs like Ventrillo (and similar). I myself use mostly ventrillo these days anymore. The testing that I did with this device was largely with guild mates of mine, on vent, telling me how the sound quality was and how it performed from their end hearing me.My history with other wireless voice chat devices on the PC:Let me give you a small amount of history on other wireless voice chat devices I have tried in the past. Before this headset I attempted to get one of the best bluetooth headset on the market paired with a high end bluetooth receiver. They paired great but everyone of my guilds screamed at me to throw that garbage out immediately and get back on my old microphone. It sounded horrible and I have to agree it really did.. but for the price I was in denial. Needless to say my 100+ dollar experience with bluetooth headsets on the pc ended in disaster (despite the fact I was using extremely expensive parts to try it.. I ended up using it on my cell phone and it sounds great there.. so I have no clue why it sounded bad on my PC (its just a different experience). I later bought a cheapy 50 dollar bluetooth headset for my PS3 and tried it on my pc again and it was worse then my 1st try. At that point I was done with trying to make bluetooth headsets work on my PC.Making the HS-1200 work for me:When I 1st put this device on and paired up the receiver with headset and started hearing my voice through the headset when I spoke.... I got instantly disappointed (this is with zero tweaking at this point). I heard a lot of digital chatter mixed in my voice. I thought to myself jeez here we go again with sub standard wireless pc chatting device. I hung in there and went into ventrillo settings and my audio console settings for windows and the new x-fi audio panel that came with the headset.. and I started turning stuff on (like the x-fi crystallizer, volume levels, sensativity settings, etc) trying to tweak it.I realized that these headphones will be best used when I don't want to have to press the \"push-to-talk\" button.. because, come on its wireless!.. I didn't wanna press to talk if I can walk around and chat. So i tweaked the sensitivity of vent just right so it didn't pick up the background speaker music and didn't turn on with my breathing. I also set it up later that my voice also plays back through my speakers (not the earphones). Thats when I was shocked. Once i heard my wireless voice over my main speakers (all of that digital chatter noise wasn't even audible when I spoke) it sounded loud and clear and totally intelligible.. perfect in fact. I hopped on my guild vent channels and no one even noticed the difference until I told them it was a new headset and it was wireless.I usually always keep the headphones around my neck and just point the mic towards my mouth and play everything back through my speakers (voice/music/everything). I spent a lot of money on my speakers and I like this loud and great sounding. With these headphones and voice activate perfectly tweaked (so its not annoying to anyone) ... this is my NEW favorite voice chat solution. I can now go get a drink and walk around for a stretch break and still be communicating with friends. Its like my xbox 360 now!On audio playback quality:The playback of audio through the earphones is ok. I tried music and I could hear everything clear. It may not have been the sharpest highest quality .. but you seriously need to keep in mind this is wireless and the signal needs to be compressed some. Despite that fact it still sounded really good. The voice definitely has a digital chatter noise when you hear yourself speak through the mic .. but only when you listen to it through the headphones (i am not sure why this is).Wireless Range:The Range of this product is approximately 20 feet (with or without normal walls). I agree this could be better. However, I play a lot of xbox 360 and the range of my xbox 360 wireless voice chat is identical.. so I am used to it. Unlike xbox it wont disconnect when that happens (which drives me nuts) What happens here is you hear your voice get garbled up when you approach the outer range. I would classify this as a short range wireless device because of that.. enough to grab a drink or stretch your legs. Not enough to go outdoors and hang out.Final thoughts:I have long wanted wireless headset to hang out and play my consoles while I chat with my PC gaming guild friends on vent.. and this allowed me to finally enjoy that world. It will definitely require setting tweaks to get to how you like it.. but mostly this was a quick out of the box experience. On a side note when you want to mute the mic you just raise the little mic boom and it shuts off the mic.

From reading other reviews, I had set my expectations pretty low on the fit and finish, bit it turns out this flash is not bad after all. Make no mistake, it is no 580EX II, but I don't think it is a poroblem for regular use. The flash is very bright, and recharge times are pretty fast with eneloop rechargeable cells. However, I find the TTL metering accuracy questionable. With E-TTL on evaluative, and Average, the flash was too bright for direct application. For shooting inside my house( focal lengths of 24mm - 105mm, distances of 6 ft - 15 ft), I had to apply -ve flash exposure compensation (between -1 & -2) to get correct exposure. The on-camera flash however did meter the exposure correctly.  Bounce flash, with +2 exposure compensation gave excellent results. If you do not plan to rely on the E-TTL, and you can afford couple of test shots to nail the exposure , this flash could be very rewarding. One problem however I noticed with the flash is that the AF assist red light pattern is misaligned - This red pattern is offset & at an angle from teh center of the lens, that in most cases the pattern is projected even outside of the frame, and hence does not provide any assistance to focussing. I tried this on two other Canon bodies to make sure this is not a misaligned hotshoe on my camera, and plan to return to Amazon & get a replacement - hoping this is a quality control issue with the specific flash I received.  Overall, this flash is worth the money, and once you figure out how to compensate the flash intensity & exposure, especially with bounce, can provide amazing results.Pros:Power ( Guide number 185)Tilt / Swivel head, allowing to bounce flash from ceiling or wall.Short recharge time.Camera recognize this flash as E-TTL compatible, and can sync with 1st or 2nd curtain.Manual controls, and user settable flash power ( 7 steps)Cons:TTL accuracy not very good, tend to over expose, need to provide manual compensation.AF Assist beam misaligned, and hence ineffectiveCould not find a compatible Stofen diffuser.

I have not experienced any problems described by others stating that the Netgear WGR614 802.11g Wireless Router needs to be restarted every week (or more). Though I have had to reset the router 2-3 times in its lifetime, the error was due to the failure of my cable broadband modem (and its restart) that required me to restart my wireless router. I had a feeling that I probably did not need to restart the Netgear wireless router, but did anyway without testing if it did not need to be restarted.I still have the problem of having to broadcast the SSID when I needed to add several newly purchased computers onto the wireless network (which I previously described as a problem). Another problem that I noticed was that when I added my father-in-law's notebook to the list, the router seemed to be confused and would only allow one computer at a time to connect to the router. I never experienced this problem with all of my computers (all 8 computers wirelessly connected to this router). I was never able to troubleshoot this problem, since he now has a wireless broadband connection (Verizon, which is excellent, but an extra $60/month) and no longer needs to use my wireless router.Another new problem is that for some reason the distance has now decreased. A year ago, I was able to have a \"Good/Very Good\" connection in the master bedroom, which is upstairs and at the other end of the house where the router is located. Now, I have \"Poor\" or no connection. I cannot pinpoint any obvious differences between now and then. I had to break out my old Netgear 802.11b router (MR814)for wireless connection upstairs, which is compatible with the WGR614 router. When I connect a Linksys compact wireless router (WRT54GC) with a high-gain antenna (HGA7S) with the same laptop (as control), I have nearly a full signal in the master bedroom, so it is possible to get excellent signal. If Netgear can provide an optional high-gain antenna for this router to improve the signal, i would definitely rate this router 5 stars!!!Also, Netgear wireless routers is still incompatible with other (products') routers, both wired and wireless. I tried to use a Linksys 802.11g router for the upstairs, but killed all network connections (both wired and wireless) when I linked up to the WGR614. Neither the WGR614 (802.11g) or the MR814 (802.11b) operates with a Linksys BEFSR41 wired router, but they work quite well with the Netgear FS608 wired switch. This is something Netgear (and maybe also Linksys) has to address.For PROs and CONs, I will stick with my original list, which I included at the bottom of this review.Conclusion:This wireless router is decent, and has obvious places for improvement. I give it 4 stars only because it works as a \"GOOD\" stand-alone wireless router for a small-to-average size place. I would give it 3 stars if I had to include its incompatibility with other products (ie. non-Netgear), and for its decrease in functionality/signal over longer distances and through several walls/barriers.I plan to copy this review and send it to both Netgear and Linksys, so that maybe they can address the issues I've posted.*** OLD REVIEW ***Prior to this purchase, I had the wireless-b version (Netgear MR814), which worked decently, when in the same room or an adjacent room. I decided to upgrade to a wireless-g router (Netgear WGR614) for three reasons: 1) To double firewall security (NAT firewall PLUS SPI firewall) compared to MR814, 2) To increase wireless range, and 3) To increase speed/rate of computer-to-computer file transfer.Setup: The setup was relatively easy. I bypassed the setup wizard, and configured the router manually. After troubleshooting some hiccups (WGR614 is not compatible with Linksys BEFSR41 router), my working setup is that the WGR614 is directly linked to my cable broadband modem, and my MR814 uplinked to the WGR614. Overall, the setup time was about 10-12 minutes.For some reason, I have to enable the broadcast of the SSID in order for my computers to find the router. I tried to force my computers to find the router manually, but failed. This is no big deal because I also secured the router by limiting the MAC addresses who can see this router, so I can specify which wireless cards (my computers) can access the router. Login to the router is different (http address), but still works the same as previous router.Speed and Distance: There is no noticeable difference with regards to web browsing. This is not surprising, because the maximum download speed of most internet broadband providers are somewhere between 1.5-3.0 Mbps (DSL) to 4-6 Mbps (Cable). Notice I say \"maximum,\" because the working speed is actually 60-70% of their boasted speeds. I have Comcast Cable Broadband, and although they say the download speeds are upwards of 6-8 Mbps, I have only \"clocked\" their speed (via Mcafee speedometer) at an average of 1.5-2 Mbps, and peaked at about 3 Mbps a few times.I've had the occasional signal drop with my HP Pavilion notebook (using the Netgear WG511 wireless-g card), but I'm not sure if it is the router or my wireless card who is at fault. I have a feeling it is on the wireless card end, because my HP Notebook workstation AND my Dell Latitude X1 have no problems with signal drop or range.It worked so well that I helped my neighbor setup the same router, but we went through the wizard, and setup went by without a glitch. He only had one laptop to setup wireless, so that made it easier.Pros:-Easy setup.-Looks clean.-Works great.-I like the \"feet\" that can be attached to this router so that it can stand.Cons:-Not possible (without modifications) to mount on a wall. MR814 are wall-mountable.-This router seems to be only compatible withNetgear hardware. I have a wired Linksys router (BEFSR41), which was compatible with the MR814, but not compatible with the WGR614. (I gave my Linksys router to my sister.)

Duran", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewText": "OK so the title seems a little obvious... rechargeable batteries do lose capacity over time. However, I expected a little better from these batteries.I have had the several sets of Sony batteries for over a year now with at least 20 charge cycles on each set. I probaby own twelve AA batteries in total along with the Sony charger. During the first year or so of use the batteries performed as expected and were pretty good. However, recently I have noticed that these batteries don't hold their charge for very long and the capacity is greatly diminished. In a very informal, unscientific test I compared the performance of my 1+ year old Sonys with a new set of (cheap Ray-O-Vac) Alkaline batteries when powering a small handheld fan from Brookstone. The new Alkaline batteries had a much stronger output than the fully charged (according to the Sony charger) batteries. Also the rundown time of the Alkaline was over twice as long as the fully charged Sony batteries. So I would say after roughly 20-30 charge cycles these Sony batteries have outlived their effective use.The reason I started performing these tests was because I noticed that, in my wireless mouse, these batteries seemed to be running empty much more frequently than in the past. I would have to change them nearly once every ten days or so of moderate use. I also noticed that fully charged batteries seemed to be completely drained after about 9-10 days in storage (in provided clear slider case). During a two week trip to Hawaii I packed a set of 4 fully charged batteries for use in my digital camera. When it came time to use the batteries, they were fully drained and would not even power on the camera. I would have to say that even though I was initially impressed with the capacity (2500mAh seems quite high), but after longer term use they have been a disappointment.I plan to purchase and test the GE/Sanyo Eneloop batteries and charger to see how they perform.

I rank the MeFoto right alongside all the others I have used; provided you recognize upfront this particular model, though called a &#34;Roadtrip Travel Tripod&#34; is, in my opinion, too heavy (at about 4 pounds) for serious backpacking but more than suitable for travel or short backpacking excursions otherwise.  In short, it represents a perfect &#34;step up&#34; from cheap tripods, without moving into tripods costing $200 or more.The MeFoto (made by Benro by the way), comes packaged very well and includes a carry case. The build quality of the tripod is very solid, no different than much more expensive tripods. All tripod controls are precision and feel good. There is no &#34;loose&#34; feeling in any regard.  The tripod leg release and adjustments are easy to adjust and lock into place even though they are twist lock, as opposed to level locks.  The build quality supports a maximum load weight of 17 pounds, which should more than sufficient for most end users at a maximum height of 61 inches, which is a good height (you really don't want to have to crouch down to look through the viewfinder).The design of the tripod is also a critical aspect that is well thought. The tripod legs fold inverted for storage and travel, making the tripod itself much shorter than otherwise possible, while not absurdly reducing the circumference or stability of the legs. Also of relevance is that the legs fold over the ball-head as well.  For comparison, the folded height is less than my very portable (Carbon Fiber) Manfrotto 190MF4 or 190MF3 when the ball-head is attached.  However, both the weight and diameter of the MeFoto is larger by comparison, which makes the Manfrotto 190 a better option for serious backpacking due to the total diameter (costs about $100 more however) but not weight; the 190 weighs in at 3.1 pounds, without ballhead as shipped (a 1/2 pound difference to the MeFoto with ballhead).  I personally found the tripod very steady and MeFoto provides a spring loaded recessed hook, located in the bottom of the center-column.  This allows you to hang additional weight from the tripod's center of gravity for increased stability and it works very well, especially if you find yourself in windy conditions (you can use a camera bag, sandbag, or waterbag).  The ability to convert the tripod to a monopod is one feature that will likely win over many end-users, especially at the non professional (i.e. Commercial shoots) user level. The monopod assembles  by screwing together the removeable center column and tripod leg, a fairly easy process.  The monopod measures in at 64&#34; extended which is right where you want it to be (or taller).  Do not under estimate the need for height in either a monopod or tripod.MeFoto includes a Q series ballhead.  The ballhead would be an additional cost in purchasing most other tripods.  The Q series ballhead is a quality ballhead by any measure and includes separate pan and head locks, a feature you will use.  I found the ballhead very smooth and precise in use with the ability to lock into place even with a heavy load, though you will have to deal with minor (very minor) shift as you lock in, as with nearly every other ballhead.MeFoto includes an arca-swiss style receiver and plate as well as a very good quality carrying bag so you can use it right out of the box.Overall, the MeFoto Roadtrip is a very strong buy.  I was impressed with the tripod and find that I am using it over my Manfrotto.

It drops half the pings to any internet site and won't even register on speedtest.net.Since I cannot blame the Router for the problems above, I have updated my rating to four stars. It would be five stars, if Netgear showed a readily available and easily located support phone number. I searched all over the place and never did find one. It should jump out both on the web site and in the user manual. It is not in either as far as I could tell.The problem was resolved by the local ISP (provider). They had a software glitch after an upgrade at their shop that would neither accept my old MAC address (on this new router) nor allow any new ones. It took 3 days for them to figure it out and one reset on their end, but they did get things working. In the mean time my old router continued to connect and work as it should have.That aside, there are several things that I like about this router (so far)1. It was very easy to configure manually. The screens/menus are rationally laid out and are ordered intuitively.2. It is large, which aids in heat dissipation (and I have a whisper quiet fan on it as well). Heat Kills. With the fan, the router runs downright cold.3. I took one of the 3 antennas off (right-most looking from the front of the router) and connected to a 1 Watt 2.4 gig amplifier (Amped). which connects to a 15 dBi gain yagi pointed at the far side of the  house. It drives the amp perfectly, and the signal at the far end of the house is now better than -39 dBm (about 80 feet down the hall and across the room.) Streaming DirecTV HD on 2.4 gig is flawless.4. The help system was very useful when setting up port forwarding. A quick read and all was well.5. The Netgear Android App works nicely with it, and will test and record multiple locations throughout the home, with signal levels. Very handy for optimization. The network mapping function of this app with the Nighthawk is superior, providing a thorough and detailed picture of the entire network. Far better and more useful than the Win7 network map. I can tap on any device shown on the network, get its description and if connected using wireless, the signal strength and connection speed are shown!6. It seems to have some internal smarts that will allow some port forwarding to occur even before it is manually set up in the advanced menu. One of my apps worked exactly as it should, even though I had not set up port forwarding yet. The help manual for the app indicated that some advanced routers will allow port forwarding to happen based on the requests from the computer (internal) itself. I was amazed, but then set it up formally anyway.7. Customization is a breeze with the Menus set up so clearly. (at least if you are used to items in a good router). Not necessarily easy for a beginner.8. Wireless range is better than with the prior router. Signals are stronger across the board on both 2.4 and 5 gigs, although I use 2.4 a lot more, as we are in the country and have virtually no competition for spectrum space.9. It has only been about 24 hours, and I have not experienced any dropped connections to either the internet as a whole, or the wireless devices to the router.Things I Don't Like: (so far)1. No easy access to phone support. The number should be included with the purchase (in the manual) and not be dependent on prior registration.2. hmmmm...I can't think of a second thing...maybe that's why it deserve(d) 4 stars!Bringing up a new router takes time. It took me over four hours to get all the devices to use the new IP and subsequent gateway, dns, etc. The wireless devices were quicker and easier to set up than the hardwired devices. We have 8 wireless devices, and at least 15 wired devices, including 3 eight port network switches (gigabit) It also required some network troubleshooting because of Windows 7 which tries to be smarter than its users by automatically making changes that fouled my home network up. For Windows XP machines, I had to either reboot or change the properties of the network card to get things straight. For Windows 7, it was easier just to reboot. In both cases, this generated the new IP, DNS and Gateway settings for each computer, but still left a messed up network that I had to troubleshoot.Overall, while early, I like what this router offers. Its wireless speeds are consistently (but not dramatically) higher than my prior router (not using any AC speed devices). The administration menu system is amazingly configurable, and logical in layout and function. This is especially true if you are already familiar with the settings in other routers. I have not tested the wired throughput speeds yet. A quick test copying a file from my laptop to a NAS drive showed 93 Mbps upload with a 150 Mbps wireless connection (2.4 gig)The real question, given some of the other reviews is. will this router stand the test of time. (No, it didn't, see below)  I sure hope so, as I like just about everything about it, even its aesthetics.N.B.If you purchase this router and can't get connected to the internet, or your connections speed is just dreadful, with dropped pings, contact your ISP, there is most likely a problem with the MAC table at the ISP, which they can fix in short order. I would do this before I contacted Netgear support. It could save you a lot of time and frustration.Update: 5/18/14The Router's WIFI performance deteriorated (speed, even at the same distance) and eventually would not even permit a connect. I had to restart the router multiple times per day and after about 10 days, even that wouldn't work. After carefully reading the reviews on this site again, I found more than one other person who had similar problems. It is a shame, this router when it worked was quite impressive, but I'm not laying gout $200 for a router and then having to troubleshoot it along with others. There is something wrong with some of these units.

It's basically a gaming headset for iOS devices (i.e., it has a microphone in addition to the headset speakers).  The plug is designed for use with iOS devices, so don't get this as a gaming headset for use with a computer (for PC gaming headsets you'll generally need a device with separate speaker and microphone plugs, or a USB headset, rather than the multi-band single-connector plug that iOS devices use).  Based on my experience so far with this headset, here's what I like and don't like:Comfort: The headphones are super comfortable and fully surround the ear.  The auto-adjusting headband is much more convenient than the design of many headsets where you have to \"click\" the two sides of the headset up or down to fit your head.  The individual ear cups pivot only in the vertical direction, relying on the flexibility of the wire headband to provide \"yaw\" (front to back rotation).  This fits fine on my head.  My only issue is that the headphones are a bit tight -- I start to feel the pressure after I've been wearing them for a while (then again, I wear an XXL hat size).  Overall, comfort is excellent.Sound:  Excellent.  I'm not an audiophile, so I can't offer a super analytical critique, but they sound great to me.  They definitely pick up highs and lows that are completing missing with earbuds.  [Update March 2012:  I've been using the headphones a lot for regular phone calls with the iPhone.  Although not as subtle as a bluetooth in-ear device, the sound quality is absolutely unbeatable, especially in a noisy environment.]Functionality:  The fact that the v2 headset has a microphone is great.  It coils back into the headset when not in use, so you don't have an annoying boom mic sticking in front of your face all the tie, and pulls out easily when needed.  The headphones with mic are great for making calls from an iPhone or Skyping from an iPad (I have an old first gen iPad, so no Facetime for me).  The inline control on the wire is a very nice feature, allowing easy control of the sound.  Surprisingly, though, it doesn't seem to have a button for muting the microphone, which would have been handy.  Also, using the control for more than simple volume control requires remembering a Morse-code style instruction set (e.g., to fast-forward, press the center button twice quickly and hold; to go to the previous song, press the center button three times quickly; etc.)Durability:  Don't know yet, but I was surprised that the cord is just a thin cord like that found on standard ear buds.  My experience has been that this is the point of failure on earbuds, and this cord issue is the reason I give this headset four instead of five stars.  I prefer the much thicker cord on my MAudio Q40 headphones -- the cord on the Q40 also has standard plug connectors on both ends so it can be replaced if it fails, whereas the cord on the Siberia v2 is hardwired into the headphones (the Q40 doesn't have a microphone and is not a substitute for the v2 -- I'm just citing it as an example of better cord design).  [UPDATE March 2012: The headphones and cord have held up well so far, so maybe the thin cord will not be an issue.  Raising my review to five stars.]Other:  The plug end of the cord needs to go all the way into the iPod/Pad/Phone socket, with the plastic barrel around the plug pushing all the way up to the device frame.  The plastic barrel around the plug is about twice the diameter of the plug itself; it fits fine through the cutout in my iPad case, but the hole in my iPhone case is a bit smaller and the plug won't go all the way in with the case on.  If you have a problem with the headphones or mic, check to make sure the plug is pushed all the way in and is not blocked by your case.Value:  Relative to the cost of PC gaming headsets with comparable features and quality, the headset is on the expensive side.  But PC gaming headsets won't with with the iPad/iPhone, so I guess the price comparison doesn't matter much.  [Update March 2012:  Price has come down.

Summersgill", "helpful": [8, 8], "reviewText": "Recently, I decided to take a road trip from my home in the San Francisco Bay Area up to a tiny little town called Fall River Mills, around 5 hours north.  I wanted to take my iPod, as there are very few worthwhile radio stations once you get on I-5 past Sacramento.  I bought Monster Cable's iCarPlay transmitter largely based on the feedback from Amazon customers.  I compared it to the iTrip and Belkin's FM transmitter, and the iCarPlay seemed to get more consistently positive feedback from Amazon customers.  I should also say that an employee at one of the Apple retail stores told me that none of these units works really well, which I suspect is an accurate and honest assessment.Installing the iCarPlay and my iPod in the car was a snap, and getting the best frequency of the preset options was fairly simple as long as the car wasn't moving.  Once the car was moving, it was difficult to know what frequency I was switching to because of the small print on the control, particularly while driving at night (I hate taking my eyes off the road even for a split second, as I'm sure most do).  You make the switch on the control, then have to tune your radio to the appropriate station and hope that it will be static free.  That part of the iCarPlay seems like it might be an accident waiting to happen.  If you're going to drive with it regularly, and don't mind switching from frequency to frequency, I'd suggest preprogramming the iCarPlay's frequencies into your car stereo's memory so that you can switch at the push of a button.I got significant amount of static on all of the preset frequencies when driving through densely populated areas - like San Francisco.  However, once I left the greater Bay Area (probably a bit past Fairfield on 80 East), the static disappeared and I had clear music virtually all the way out to my destination near Mount Shasta, which is close to 5 hours away.  It probably wasn't CD-quality audio, but it was good enough that I didn't notice the difference.  I did have to jack the volume up a bit, but beyond that I was impressed.The end result to me is that I'm pleased that I bought the Monster Cable iCarPlay.  I'll keep it in my car for long road trips, and I know I'll be happy to have it on those occasions.  However, for day-to-day driving in the Bay Area, the static will be too much of a hassle and I probably won't bother.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great for rural driving, but...", "unixReviewTime": 1097712000, "reviewTime": "10 14, 2004"}

This speaker system does what all the other great reviews out there say it does, so I won't go into the virtues of how great this speaker system sounds. Other reviewers did a great job doing that.What I do want to get into is the MAJOR DESIGN flaw Altec Lansing has designed into this speaker system. As other users have noted, and as the user's manual states, when running on battery mode, the speaker is eqipped with an auto shut-off feature that will shut down the speakers if no audio is detected within 2-3 minutes. What this means for you is, you will be happily listening away to your Ipod on this system, and it will shut down in the middle of a song without warning. For whatever reason, when on battery mode, the system does not detect when my Ipod is docked, and the built-in auto shut off feature kicks in without warning. This really, really sucks because the selling features for me on this system were the great reviews on sound, and the fact that I could listen to this anywhere there wasn't power. (I planned on taking this on  camping trips,etc.) Those were my two requirements in a portable sound system such as this.There *is* a workaround if you are willing to give up the docking feature and most features on the remote while in battery mode. You can buy an auxillary cable and use the auxillary input plugin, and listen to your Ipod this way. I have tried this, and the annoying shut-down feature does not engage while in auxillary mode. The thing you give up, as mentioned, is the docking feature, and the remote will only control your volume at this point. You can't change tracks, etc. with the remote with the workaround.I really wish Altec Lansing would have a way to turn off the auto-shut off feature, and if they did, this little unit would have earned a 5 star review from me. Until they fix this major design flaw, and either give me my money back or send me a new unit with a switch to tun off the auto shut off, this review will only get 1 star. I am reluctantly keeping this unit because it does still sound good and does everything as all reviewers promised while plugged into a power source. The workaround mentioned will still enable me to get great sound while on camping trips, but it's a total bummer that I have to carry an extra cord around with me now for this, my Ipod can't dock,  and I give up almost every feature of the remote. This should not be the case because of a stupid design flaw!I tested this unit out with an Itouch 3rd generation. If anyone else discovers some kind of workaround that would enable me to keep my Ipod docked, please, please let me know!

After receiving this Otterbox case for my iPad 2 I was greatly disappointed. It was cheap looking and didn't have ANYTHING to protect the screen. Which is unlike Otterbox.The plastic feels very cheap in your hand. I had a hard time placing my iPad in the case without scratching the device, or breaking the case trying to get it on. The silicone outer piece fits over the hard plastic to offer a shock absorbing case.The silicone outside didn't fit right. It has cut outs for all your ports but I couldn't get the little flap, that protects the port against dust, to stay closed. I found it kind of defeated the purpose.Not to mention this case adds a substantial amount of bulk and weight to the iPad. I would have sacrficed the small size and low weight for a case that would protect my device against dropping and scratches. This case just doesn't do that. At almost 50.00 a case, I would expect a superior protection and awesome quality. Otterbox missed the mark on this one!

The cover actually says it includes instructions but mine didn't, it just had graphics in the lid. That you find inside is the long silver bar, a silver test tube shaped piece and the micro usb cord and you have to assume you have everything you need to --- fiddle around and hope you figure it out!  LOL  Okay so it took a minute but the test tube is the rechargeable battery that I tried to fit on the silver tray bar until my rather slow brain figured out that it goes into the side of my track pad (or your wireless keyboard if you were using one). So I take the cap off the side of the track pad and screw in the battery pack and I now have no mouse activity. That's right, our friends at Mobee didn't even eek out a tiny bit of reserve for us to get things in order.Intuitively, I knew to put the track pad on the bar recharger and it blinked green (the blinking light ledger is printed clearly in the box lid). But now I'm without a mouse  for what I suspect is for the rest of the day (so do this part at night unless you have an extra mouse floating around).When charged, it was exciting and works as it always did but here's the question I have.Should I only bring the bar out at night for recharging?  Or is it bad just to leave the trackpad/wireless keyboard on the bar?  I know technology teaches us to fully charge the batteries and then let them run out but My trackpad would go for a couple of months without a need for new batteries when I was using batteries. The downloadable manual is kinda fun as it has a maze of other languages and basically little information, but I did run across a message that said expect about 3 days of use before needing to recharge. So I'm just going to keep mine in the bar at night because I can't afford to be without my trackpad for 6 hours should it die.I guess I have mixed feelings. It's an extra \"thing\" on my desk that is going to be needed every 3 days or batteries with at minimum go for a month (but usually more).

The colors are absolutely spectacular. Rich, vivid greens and blues, blacker than black, and bright whites. The cabinet is pretty slick too and will definitely compliment any room you decide to place it in.I will say, that out of the box, the picture needs some work. You will need to do some tuning to dial in the tint, contrast, brightness, and saturation. The default \"dynamic,\" \"standard,\" and \"movie\" settings don't really do it justice. You can adjust the picture settings for each input. In other words you can have different settings for your DVD player and your HDTV box. I would recommend getting a calibration disc to take full advantage of the capability of this HDTV. It's well worth the 20 or 30 bucks for the disc.Shortly after I purchased this set, I picked up a Toshiba HD-DVD player. The picture and sound both are nothing short of Fantastic. Stunning, detailed images and deep, rich sound in 5.1. HD cable is just as impressive on this display.Another thing I like about this model is the user-menu. A slick \"windowsish\" type menu with adjustable transparency, and it's very easy to see exactly what your adjustments to contrast, saturation, etc... are doing to the picture. Another nice feature in the menu is the Digital Noise Reduction switch. I usually leave it turned off for high quality digital sources, but I find that it does wonders for some older standard definition DVDs and some standard definition tv channels.With standard ground shipping, Amazon had this TV in my living room in 7 days.

The build seems plenty strong to carry the indicated 160 lb max weight and the glossy finish on the product is nice, even if you'll never see it once it's installed. Assembly is a straight-forward, simple process, which is good for me because I'm about as mechanically disinclined as they come. If I can install it, _anyone_ can. Having said that, though, there are a few issues with this mount.The primary issue is that wall studs in US construction are spaced at 16\" intervals, but the screw holes in the mount are not. So, you will only be able to get a single column of screw holes to line with a stud. The rest will need to go into drywall (assuming your walls aren't concrete). My advice would be to go to your nearest hardware store and pick up 6-8 100 lb drywall screws. This will ensure that the frame isn't going anywhere.A secondary issue, and this is probably true for all non-swing wall mounts, is that you have no access to the back of the TV if you need to add a component hookup. To do so you'll have to take the TV off the wall. Not particularly hard to do and adding components isn't something that should happen very often, so this is a minor quibble.Finally, the built-in level is indeed inaccurate. Mine did come with an additional level, which I used alongside my own level, one on each side of the frame, to ensure the frame was plumb. It seems like they could have saved a small amount on cost by eliminating the useless built-in level, which would also add a bit of extra rigidity to the frame as well.Would I buy this product again? For the price, certainly.

Although my experience with Dell customer service leaves much to be desired, I really don't have anything bad to say about the TV. I've been nothing but thrilled since I've gotten it. Sure, I'm sure part of it is because it's my first high def TV, but I'm also very critical of my large purchases. This TV also had high expectations to live up to, since I had read so many positive things in other reviews.I'll start off with picture quality, because that's what most people want to know about. I'm completely pleased with it overall, and would definitely recommend it to others. Some people have said that it's obviously 720p, but I honestly can't tell the difference. My brother recently purchased a 54\" 1080p plasma, and granted the picture was nicer than mine, but it wasn't worth the price he paid -- almost triple what this TV costs! For the low price of this TV, the picture quality can't be beat! The color saturation and contrast is great, as are the black levels. It isn't exactly as crisp as I had expected, but I think this may be in part because I have only watched high def programming via cable TV so far. I have yet to test it with a BluRay player. However, I generally notice even better results when I stream HD videos via the HDMI connection on my laptop. In any event, turning up the sharpness level is much more effective on this TV than on old standard def TVs, and that does help quite a bit. Picture controls are great too... I like the layout of the menus, and there are plenty of options to tweak the picture to your liking. I generally don't need to use the black level enhancement because the blacks are so rich already, but I love the dynamic contrast feature under advanced settings. There is a low, medium and high setting (just like the black enhancement) and it does a wonderful job at making colors pop. It can make great video look even more vivid, and it's especially great for bringing some life into dreary looking programming.The sound quality is not nearly as bad as I had expected. I'm actually quite pleased with it. It won't act as a home theater system by any means, but for TV sound it is more than adequate. It wasn't complained about much, but there were several people who seemed displeased. I now think they probably hadn't adjusted the settings in the proper way. The \"SRS TruSurround HD\" definitely needs to be turned on and left on. That is definitely the most important sound aspect. It isn't like most simulated surround that just adds a lot of echo... it actually has very little echo. It makes the sound fuller, emphasizes the bass a little, and makes it more pleasing overall. It really gives it more of a high def sound, rather than the flat/boring sound you're used to from old tube TVs. Apart from that, I used the EQ to add a little bass because that's how I prefer it, and I am good to go. I have it hooked up to my stereo and I rarely even use it.As far as the infamous buzzing issue goes, I don't have an issue with it. The TV does have a very slight buzz from its normal operation, but it is only barely noticeable when the TV is paused/muted. It is completely normal from what I've read, and is normal with any plasma TV. That was a relief because it was the thing I was most worried about. I did some research though, and came to find out that the buzzing sound becomes worse in higher altitudes. I live in Michigan and my elevation is a mere 594 feet, so I am sure this is why I have no issue with the buzzing sound. However, if you live in high altitudes, do some extensive research before buying ANY plasma TV.Another issue I was worried about was the stand, and attaching it to the TV. Almost every single review I read said it was incredibly difficult to insert the screws, and some people even recommended using lubricant or a power drill. However, I had no issue at all. I used a regular screwdriver from the toolbox and was not at all strained by tightening the screws all the way. I am assuming that this issue must have been resolved since the TV was released.The TV is very elegant and classy looking. The glossy finish does attract dust quite easily, but a microfiber cloth is included. The build of the TV and stand seems very sturdy and it does not look cheap at all. For being one of the cheapest plasmas out there, it sure doesn't look like it.This TV has also opened my eyes to the world of plasma -- since everyone I know has LCD, I had pretty much decided in the beginning that I would get it. However, I was limited to Dell.com and the only LCD in my price range had gotten some pretty negative reviews. So, I did some research on plasma and decided to give it a try. I must say that I am incredibly pleased and I have come to find out that I prefer plasma to LCD. The picture is much warmer, less artificial looking and the plasma technology is what gives you such rich colors and deep blacks. Those aspects of this TV will not be found in any LCD in a similar price range. Keep in mind that any light source aimed at the TV will reflect off the screen, so you can't set a lamp next to the TV or have a window open with light shining directly on it. Oh, but definitely buy an extended warranty with this TV... because I've read many bad things about Samsung's customer service, and you'll want something to fall back on just in case.In closing, I can't stress enough how happy I am with my purchase. This TV is the best bang for your buck in the price range and it really delivers! As of March 2011, I'd say $450 or less is quite a good price for the TV. A little haggling got me down to $400, but trust me... the extra $50 would have still been worth it!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent entry level HDTV!", "unixReviewTime": 1299801600, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2011"}

If you know you want one, these are the ones to get.But the Netgear promotional material above is carefully-worded. It never quite says that networking your electronic devices is easy. It says that establishing a network among powerline adapters is easy. Getting your  devices to recognize and work with that network, though, can be either easy or a nightmare, depending on your particular devices and their set-up. It's not any harder with these adapters than with hard-wired or wireless networks, but it isn't any easier.Powerline networks also face the problem that your power lines weren't designed to be networks. There are a lot of signals on the lines -- garbage signals kicked back from computers, appliances, and other things. Network signals have to fight through that traffic. (That's why these adapters have filtered outlets -- the stuff you want to network is often the stuff putting out the most garbage, so the filter prevents it from getting to the power lines -- but you have a lot of other, unfiltered stuff plugged into your walls.) In addition, your wiring may be new and good like an interstate highway, or old and cruddy like a dirt road. These things affect how fast  the network can be and how far it can reach. It slows down with distance and eventually can't get through. That's why these adapters also have LEDs to tell you how good the signal is.I don't want to overstate the problem; wireless networks also have issues with speed, distance, and interference. But the speed of a powerline network is very much a your-mileage-may-vary thing. These adapters are rated at 200 MBps. On paper that's much faster than the common wireless-g network standard (though slower than the newer wireless-n). But you won't get 200, or anywhere near it. Maybe you'll be faster than wireless, maybe not (especially because wireless network speed is also YMMV). And you won't have the convenience of a wireless network.If you really want a wired network, consider having the wires put in your walls. It isn't really all that big or expensive a deal (people don't hesitate to call the cable tv company to come put in a new outlet or move an old one, after all, and that's basically the same process). And its a much faster network than powerline or wireless (but also much faster than you probably need). If you don't want to do that, though, and for some reason don't want wireless, buy these.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good units but consider the issues and alternatives", "unixReviewTime": 1275264000, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2010"}

This time the doc actually said they did replace the shutter.  I set out to test it--shooting over 500 shots in and hour on the Ch setting and then going to the park and shooting a f22 all day. Only 1 spot is on the sensor and that one seems to have been there since it was returned. But no additional spots so far.[UPDATE 16Oct2013] After a month of using the D600 _after_ Nikon Service updated the Shutter for me, I am seeing a few more spots on the sensor. I haven't shot a lot of photos -- maybe in the 200 - 300 range, however, there are now a handful of substantial spots on the sensor once again--even with the fix. So if they truly did replace the shutter with that used in the D610, I'm not optimistic about the D610 nor am I'm relaxed about owning the D600.[UPDATE 16Sept2013] I just received my D600 back from Nikon Service. During the NAB in Las Vegas earlier this year, a Nikon Rep told me that they had a \"quiet\" service practice for D600. She said \"Send it in\". I didn't bother doing that until early September of this year and got it back 10 days later. They paperwork said \"clean sensor, upgrade firmware\" so I was concerned. I called and the Service Tech said, yes there's more to it than that, but he wasn't allowed to say--but he did say \"They fixed the problem\".  After a lengthy test shoot of the Sky, timelapse of nature and several \"party\" shots, I see Zero Dust/Grease whatever on the pictures. I believe this camera is now fixed. Thank you Nikon and of course Amazon for the best Customer Service ever![UPDATE 29Nov2012] The 4th unit is now going back to Amazon. This D600 was oil-free and I was very happy for the first 100 or so images. Then excessive dust started to appear. I \"let it go\" for about a week and it seems to have settled down. I called Nikon who told me I could not clean the sensor myself--it had to be sent to a Nikon Authorized service center. But my experience with Nikon service while good, is also VERY time consuming. So this unit is now on its way back to Amazon and another one has been ordered. Let's hope we get both no oil and little to no dust on this one. (Fingers crossed)[UPDATE 21Nov2012]I'm on the 4th D600 from Amazon.com (gotta love their fantastic customer service).The other 3 units had Oil spots either right after shooting or came with oil already on the sensor.This unit seemed okay for the first 40 or so images, and then I saw some particles of dust (not oil) on the sensor. I blew it away and shot another \"roll\" and saw even more dust and what I believe to be 1 or possibly 2 tiny oil spots (the prior units had larger oil spots).Regardless of how good the image quality is, if you can't depend on the product to product pictures vs dusty images (or oily images) it isn't worth your time.My pure speculation is that some units have oil and some have excessive dust. Oil being caused by Nikon assembly workers over-oiling a poorly designed shutter mechanism, and dust if they did not over oil the shutter mechanism. So you get one bad feature or the other.The other camera I have is a D800e and it now has 1 oil spot after roughly 1000 images. I may send it in to be cleaned, assuming no more appear. But this being the 4th D600 I'm going to conclude, based on what I've read here and from my own experience, that this model is definitely NOT ready for prime-time.I would suggest you put off your purchase until either they replace this module with a new one (one that has the problems resolved) or you invest in a cleaning kit and become what most consumers are not, a camera cleaning expert.Oh, and those who keep saying \"are you sure its oil and not dust\" please move along until you actually own one of these models, you're boring the rest of us who are actually trying to make this camera with great potential, work.[Original Review]This camera produces some of the best pictures of any Nikon yet. Sure the D800/e has more pixels, but a 50% increase in those pixels makes your computer run slow as it reads/processes them. Plus, the camera itself slows down as it processes 36 megapixels (again on the D800). This camera has just the right mix of features.So unless you're a pro, this should be your camera if you're a Nikon shooter (or get he new CANON 5D Mk III if you prefer CANON, both are great).This is a full-frame camera, not a Pro Camera. It has all the scene modes you've used from the D7000 but gives you that great depth of field results you normally only see in an FX (full frame) model.Likewise you can use Program/Pro mode, or Aperture or Shutter Priority modes and pull fantastic shots.The Good: FX sensor, 24 megapixels is good enough, more would be a negative feature, fits all your Nikon lens, but start buying FX (non-DX) lenses if you haven't already; it has a fast enough shutter speed and great colors.The not so good: The focus sensors have been purposely crippled on this camera. Instead of using an FX autofocus array from the D4, D800 or other cameras, they use the same autofocus array used on the  D7000 DX camera. This cheat means that you basically have a small area in the center of the view finder in which focus occurs. While this is really offensive to me as a consumer, (shame on you Nikon) it isn't a show-stopper. It too borders on \"good enough\" but I do find it irritating in some situations. So while focus is perhaps the biggest shortcoming feature, it shouldn't stop you from selecting this over other models.Last, like all 2012 Nikon cameras, this model too tends to overexpose its photos when not using matrix metering (e.g., spot metering). So I tend to have to shoot at -0.3ev all the time. The more I use the matrix metering however, I'm learning to know when the camera will work with it vs spot metering. The over exposure that can occur in spot metering (I'm speculating) was done to accommodate those \"ultra stupid hi ISO\" features. If you want to shoot in the dark, get a camera with night vision.So unless you're a professional, get the D600, you'll love it. If you're a pro... keep your D3 or get the D4 or for B-roll consider the D800.OIL SPOTS:One caveat: The original D600 I received was wonderful until I hit about 100 photos. Then a bunch of oil spots on the \"sensor\" (actually on the anti-alias filter) started to appear. Apparently if the person or machine on the assembly line didn't have their coffee, they might have over-oiled the shutter release on your camera. Now, it is easy to clean off dust particles, but oil is problematic. If you look around, you'll see two types of users writing about this issue: Those who received a good unit that doesn't show the problem and who falsely conclude that is never happens, and those who are having the issue. To see if yours has the issue, shoot a photo of the blue sky, and look at it on your computer. If you see little grey or slightly dark orbs, you have the problem. I originally had zero, then about 5, then it went to over 20 spots. One or two is nothing--it won't show up on your prints or elsewhere. But one or two dozen, that's a problemThe great thing about getting your cameras from Amazon.com is you can return/exchange it for another unit. And that's what I did.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Best Nikon Yet but wimpy focus area", "unixReviewTime": 1352332800, "reviewTime": "11 8, 2012"}

I listen to music with it practically every day. The sound these things produce still impress me even to this day. I'm not kidding. The surround sound is truly amazing.

Listening to music really is a pleasure. It's like literally being at a recording studio or live concert.  I forget I'm even wearing headphones with these. When watching movies, I really feel like I'm actually in a theater. Actually, it sounds better than the theaters. This headphone makes me listen to some music I normally wouldn't care so much for, on a regular headphone that lacks depth. It really makes you appreciate the beauty of sound. You can clearly hear the vocals, the instruments, and effects, clearly as separate channels instead of everything muffled together. Truly surround sound. Depending on the music or movie, one can get detailed sounds from all angles one normally wouldn't notice on a regular speaker or headphone.The cushion muffs is large and comfortable. It can often attract dust, so you'll want to use those sticky rollers when that happens. There's also a leather cushion on the top of the headphone; a lot thicker than the lower Sennheiser models. There's only one plug that connects to the headphones, so it's nice you don't get cords dangling on both sides when listening.The only con would be that sound leaks a lot, since these are open headphones. In other words, people can really hear what you're listening to. Then again, open headphones are preferable if you want a natural sound.

The trouble with most headsets is that once they tend to pick up all of the noise in the background, forcing a recorder to turn off their precious air conditioning and fans, and pray their computer is quiet enough to not be heard.Not with this baby. I was prepping for an amateur recording session with a friend and wanted to make sure I had everything in order. I ran a few tests: shaking my head back, forth, up, and down; jumping in place; pacing; running a standing fan (on three power levels); and running my in-window AC unit, which blows air right to my computer. After a few trials, I realized that NONE of these things were being picked up. I had to silence everything to verify, since I couldn't believe it. I recorded with the AC and fan off and then on, and the only noticeable change was when the AC unit beeped at me saying I had successfully powered it on. There was hardly even a hum on the recording track. I also have long hair, and headsets I've used in the past have picked up the noise made when my hair brushes against the headphones or boom mic; nary was a hair heard by this headset.One might think that with all of this awesome non-pickup that the recording quality of what IS picked up would be awful. Not the case. My voice came through clearly with all of my sibilance intact. The mic is good enough to pick up throat clearing and swallowing, however, so be careful when recording (or learn to post-process/edit this stuff out).The headset's earpieces are labeled with L and R for their designated sides, but if the wearer finds them uncomfortable, the boom mic rotates all the way back for a reversible wearer. That person should note that, of course, the sound made for the right channel will be heard by the left ear and vice versa. Not to say that these are uncomfortable, they're very nice; but lobe earrings might get squished between the ear padding and the jawbone and might cause discomfort. The USB cord is about 6' long, with a mute/vol+/vol-/call button on a plastic block about 2' from the headset; the cord enters the headset on the 'left' earpiece (So, technically, the main pic on Amazon's product page is of the headset backwards). The headband is adjustable for various head sizes, even for those of us with oddly-shaped heads. They aren't the daintiest of headsets, so someone looking to keep up with the latest fashion trends might want to keep away. If they are too bulky, one can rest the headset around their neck and use the boom mic to record, while using their computer's speakers to listen.No software was required to set up or calibrate the headset; but the user might want to download Skype for chatting or Audacity for recording, both free.Of note is that this headset is compatible with the iPad via the Camera Connection Kit, making it useful for Skype or recording on there as well (though portability might be an issue).In short, this is a great quality headset for those in noisy rooms who don't want to sacrifice quality, or a chunk of cash.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent pickup for amateur recordings", "unixReviewTime": 1355702400, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2012"}

At this point, I own twelve pairs (I know - I have a problem) encompassing a wide range of styles from the inexpensive AKG 240s to the high end Beyerdynamic DT 880s. Impressively, the Brainwavz R3s compare quite favorably to some headphones that cost much more.Since these are canalphones, I&#8217;ll base my primary comparison on a similar pair that I own by Etymotic Research - the ER4Ss.The Etymotics are more than twice as expensive as the R3s and they do have an edge in terms of absolute sound quality. They have a higher impedance, which is a blessing and a curse. The ER4Ss have a greater dynamic range, but they also require more voltage to drive. This means that they sound flat and lifeless unless you&#8217;re using a headphone amplifier, which isn&#8217;t terribly convenient. In contradistinction, the R3s have a lower impedance, which makes them much more satisfying when using a low voltage device like a laptop, iPod, or smartphone. You&#8217;ll get an additional layer of sonic detail and dynamic shading with the more expensive ER4Ss, but the inconvenience is a significant factor.Beyond sound quality, there are a few things that the R3s do much better. The Etymotics use a tiny threaded cable that provides virtually no protection from vibration, which means that if you move the cables, you&#8217;ll hear a lot of microphonics. This is a problem inherent in all canalphones, but the R3s use a thicker, rubberized cable, which dampens some of the microphonic vibrations. This makes a big difference, especially if you&#8217;re not planning on sitting quietly every time you want to listen to music.The bottom line is that the R3s sound very good and they are much more practical than the ER4Ss. You can get a nice, full sound from a portable device, and you can wear them without noticing as many microphonic disturbances.The R3s have a few other nice features that make them worth checking out. They come with a huge variety of ear tips in all shapes and sizes. When using canalphones, it&#8217;s absolutely crucial that you get a good seal, otherwise you&#8217;ll lose any sort of bass presence. With all the varieties Brainwavz includes, you&#8217;re sure to find something that works for your ears.The R3s also come with a nice carrying case that is rigid enough to provide protection if you want to toss it into a backpack or something. The Etymotics also come with a little case, but it&#8217;s soft and doesn&#8217;t do much to protect what&#8217;s inside. As an added bonus, Brainwavz also throws in an airplane adaptor, which is not something I&#8217;ve seen from any other headphone company. All in all, they really give you a nice array of accessories.Now, a few words about the sound of the R3s. The sonic signature seems very well balanced. There is plenty of bass, but it&#8217;s not overpowering. The highs are smooth, and the always important midrange feels relaxed and natural. Where the Etymotics sound more precise and analytical, the R3s sound punchy and forward. Because they have more bass presence than the Etymotics, the R3s are better suited for certain musical styles like rock, electronic, and the like. They do a good job with more acoustic styles like jazz, classical, and mellow singer-songwriter stuff, but they&#8217;re best at louder, more electronically grounded styles. That said, I was pleased with the performance of the R3s with virtually every recording I tested them with.Since most people will be using the R3s with some sort of low voltage, portable device, that&#8217;s primarily how I tested these; however, I also listened through my high-end headphone amplifier just to see how they performed under the best possible conditions. I didn&#8217;t actually notice a huge difference in sound quality. There was a bit more detail and the dynamic range improved somewhat, but really, these sound just about as good coming straight out of an iPhone.Overall, the R3s are a great value. The sound is very good, the accessories are useful, and the price is great. I highly recommend them!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent sound quality, excellent value", "unixReviewTime": 1399420800, "reviewTime": "05 7, 2014"}

They put it on the stand for me but did not wait until it was switched on before leaving so I guess that was OK, if I had paid for the white glove delivery I would have been annoyed ($250?) but as it was free I guess it was OK.BTW when I bought the TV white glove delivery was not an option, it came with free standard shipping, which was going to be a problem as I live in a 1st floor apartment and this TV is 120lbs.  But after speaking to Amazon they said that any TV over 27\" gets white glove for free!!So to the TV, it came in perfect condition and well packed, the eagle guys took away the packaging as I asked them to.  I switched on the TV and connected it to Cablevision HD via a HDMI cable running through my Onyko AV amp.The picture is excellen in HD and pretty good in SD.  HD from close up is pretty perfect with no ghosting or anything like that.  SD from close up i.e. 5 \" away shows the lack of bandwidth on the feed.  But from 6' or more its fine to watch.I was a bit worried about IR with this TV as its a plasma but the only time I ever saw a but of it was when I ran the auto setup for my Onyko 605 which basically puts a very vivid DOS type screen up for around 15 minutes, I saw the lines for the boxes for about 1 miniute after I changed channel but they quickly disappeared.I put this down to being one of the first images I ran on the new TV as I have since run setup several times after around 50 hours of use with no IR.I also have run through my 360 and HDDVD through this TV, its excellent with these.  Great colors and pin sharp picture, no lag at all and no IR with games after hours of play!This TV is great value, I paid $2300 no tax delivered and there is nothing out there to touch it at this orany price under $3000...believe me I looked for over 18months.Buy it and enjoy it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "fantastic Picture, Fantastic quality, fantastic price!!", "unixReviewTime": 1189641600, "reviewTime": "09 13, 2007"}

Fist, I read a number of great things about EVGA cards.  I was unable to convince myself to spend the $450+ on the GTX 580, and the color scheme of the 570 series matched the components of my build.I was a little confused on the difference between the GTX 570 Superclock and the GTX 570 Superclock HD, so I decided to call EVGA and ask them.  Ends up that although the HD has an additional port type, and a full size HDMI port (instead of the HDMI mini) it used less precious metal on its board and there for was $20 cheaper.  This didn't make too much sense to me, but if that is what the sales rep was going to tell me, I believed him and went with the cheaper card with more display port options.I was a little concerned about the airflow in this model compared to the normal superclock, as it looked like it had a different fan and smaller exhaust.  To be fair, I have done some modifications to my NZXT Gamma case so the air flow might not be optimal  When running Battlefield 3 on Ultra settings on a 25\" 1080p Monitor I took the card to full ram capacity and around 80 to 90 Celsius. Since then I have added a few new fans and attempted to improve the airflow.  I'm still seeing high temps when playing playing battlefield 3 on ultra settings, but I'm playing battlefield 3 on ultra settings... and getting 60 frames... is there more I could ask for?For the price of this card, it's hard to go wrong.

So why did I see a need to go further?  It was prompted by my getting into interval training (run/walk, run/walk, etc.)  I could not hear the transition points with the somewhat muted tone of the 305.  So I figured there was some other way to get the transition message, maybe bluetooth.  I didn't even think about vibration.In my search, I happened upon this Garmin FR 310XT for around $200.  There was an even later release of the 910 for around $450, but that would be overkill for my purposes (I'm not into decathlon-type activities).My primary motivator for the purchase of the 310 was the ability to feel the vibration at the transition points.  Perfect.  I can be running and walking along, listening to my music through earphones, and know exactly when to do the next leg of the workout.OK.  That said, it was worth every bit the price just for the vibration.  But I discovered that almost everything about the 310XT was an improvement over the 305.  Where do I begin?  The chest strap for heart-rate monitoring is vastly improved from a comfort standpoint.  Setting values, such as setting the intervals, is so much easier than it was in the 305.  Many of the other improvements are covered by many other reviews, such as longer battery life and the ability to see remaining battery life (after two days of workouts, I was at 97% capacity remaining), quicker connection to satellites (never was a big deal with 305, but nice to get the connection quicker in order to get going), slightly smaller footprint without sacrificing the 4-readings per page capability, waterproof (not that I will swim with it, but comforting to know that getting stuck in the rain will not harm the watch), etc.  It retains all the great features that are present in the 305, so nothing is sacrificed.One more key point to make about the vibration.  Without vibration, for intervals I was needing to watch the screen count down as it got closer to the transition.  With the vibration, I can be viewing other screens if I want to see other indicators like avg speed, heart rate, etc., and the vibration will let me know it's time.  Or if you want, you can do the entire workout without ever having to look at the GPS watch.I have yet to try it when bicycling.  I know that I'm going to want to do interval training with the bicycle, which would have been difficult without the vibration.Net, net, a must have.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Loved my Garmin FR 305; this one goes way beyond it", "unixReviewTime": 1379808000, "reviewTime": "09 22, 2013"}

This thing really doesn't need a big cardboard box around it. Find a better way, guys!Okay, now on to the review:  I like it.Want more? Oh, alright...  The I-Spire Tablet Lift does exactly what it is advertised to do: It lets you mount/prop your tablet a little higher than just propping it directly on the tabletop, and it provides a sturdy support that won't leave you with a shattered screen. It handles portrait or landscape mode like a champ on my Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, and the space below gives me a little room to prop up my Bluetooth keyboard. Solid construction and smart planning means it won't slip, either.There are no moving parts. It's a solid piece of plastic-like material. It's relatively lightweight, but doesn't feel flimsy at all.With this tablet lift, a Bluetooth keyboard, and a Bluetooth mouse, you can turn an Android tablet into a nice little desktop computer. Alas, the iPad lacks mouse support so you'll need to tap the screen to make things happen. I'm pretty sure the I-Spire will be fine with exclusively touch-screen input, but just be aware that tapping means potentially pushing the tablet over the back of the I-Spire. The back support it relatively tall, but it might still give way if you're tapping at the top of your iPad screen in portrait mode.Obviously, this is meant to work without a thick case on your tablet. I cannot attest to its usability if you leave your specific case on your tablet. I use mine without a case on this tablet lift, and I am relatively confident that it will come to no harm while nestled in the groove.I really like this thing!

This unit replaced a Panasonic DMP-BD35k player I've had for almost 2 years.  I wanted something that would allow me to stream netflix and Pandora as well as improve(if possible) the sound and picture.  For an under $200 player, this unit addresses those things (that some $500 players don't) and I'm quite happy with my purchase.I find it very nice to see 24p available on DVD's as well as blu-ray discs.  The jitter reduction(for sound sent via HDMI) is a fantastic idea I haven't even seen mentioned in anyone else's literature with blu-ray players.  This new chroma processer seems to do a good job, detail is excellent with DVD's or blu-ray.Although the tube sound audio seems a bit gimmicky, I prefer it with it on.  It seems to give a subtle(but noticable...my girlfriend could tell) better soundstage with a fatter lower midrange and slightly rolled off highs(in other words tubelike sorta).  I'm not sure I'd go trading in that Conrad-Johnson preamp but it's a nice feature to experiment with.To my eyes and ears, this unit does a beter job than my old unit even if it's evolutionary not revolutionary. It does not play SACD or DVD-Audio discs.They moved the \"display\" button so it's now smaller in a more crowded area...and I use this alot(esp when switching from watching a blu-ray to a DVD to change the picture type soft, fine, cinema...).  So the remote is a bit smaller and not as well laid out(and it's still not backlit) but for the price, I find it hard to really complain.  It loads a bit faster than my old one but it's still not exactly speedy.  BTW, the quick-start feature means the unit is on all the time so you'll have to decide how green you want to be there.If your looking for a player that loads fast, there are better choices but for those that are picture and sound quality focused(obsessed?), this player is an excellent choice(unless your going to buy the Oppo at 3X the price).PS haven't used the streaming features yet although I did get it to recognize my router and that process was quite easy.Update(literally)...after making the wireless connection the unit did a firmware update that made a significant difference in picture quality with DVD's.  Initially, I noticed some moire patterns around objects during motion sequences.  Afterwords, the picture was free of these artifacts and with 24p engaged it was a definite improvement.Update...having spent time listening to the player in the different sound modes, the better the soundtrack the more I like any sound effect off.  Hi def  soundtracks are a little \"dulled\" by the tube sound setting.

On the plus side of this, you get a brighter picture in the dark than you were expecting)* Focus ring is very thin and \"plastic-y\" (works good though)* No manual over-ride when in AF mode (not that big a deal)* Colors are a little muted for my taste (bumping the saturation up, or post processing clears this right up)* f/2 is shallow... very shallow (good focus is a must at this aperture)* Background \"Bokeh\" reflects 5 sides of the aperture blades* AF is noisy (in comparison to HSM lenses)At it's price, I have no problem recommending it to anybody who's thinking about buying one. It's an EXCELLENT lens for the money, and much better build quality than the Canon 50mm f/1.8 \"fantastic plastic\" (as can be seen in the increase in cost, however).

This time around, I'd learned enough that I did it all by hand, and had no problems.

While at the Apple store, I decided I also needed the leather Smart Cover.  At first I was impressed with the quality of the cover.  It smelled like really nice leather, and the smooth leather grain looked like it would age very well (giving a classic leather worn look eventually).  I also think the close/open to lock/unlock is a nifty trick.As others have pointed out though, there are same gaping flaws (I supposed Apple is not immune).  First, the cover is not useful at all as a stand.  Standing up, it is way too unstable, and at a low angle, it's pretty useless.  I tried it on the plane, and I just couldn't stand it up without it wobbling and falling over occasionally.Also, the cover leaves oily residue on the glass screen.  Now, this isn't a \"huge flaw\" just an annoyance.  I don't think this would cause any type of temporary or permanent damage.Lastly, the magnetic hinge is just not strong enough.  I understand the limitations of magnets and I think it's definitely a cool implementation.  However, they're just not strong enough to hold up to carrying with it unfurled, or reading it in bed trying to prop up the iPad on my stomach.  It's just frustrating since it falls off quite a bit.I'll keep it, since it looks nice (and that's what we pay for, right?)  But I've already purchased an InCase stand cover that actually does a great job of protecting the iPad.  It can also prop up the iPad in a VERY stable position.

After looking at the Zune HD in a retail location, I was fairly amazed at the how beautiful the hardware was and how sleek and simple the user interface performed.  As I have no religious affiliation with Apple or any other consumer electronics manufacturer, the Zune HD seemed like a terrific value at its price point compared to the (uhum) competition.  I like Apple just fine, but their prices are no longer in my personal zone of reality, especially for commodity hardware that just about any one can make.  Please don't troll my reviews and slam me for having an open mind as far as consumer electronics goes.  It is not interesting.  Caveat:  I am a engineer in the computer industry, and have been for 25 years....I proceeded to purchase 2 of them for 2 of my teenage daughters (the other was perfectly happy with her Sansa).  The Zune HDs looked so innocent and happy under the tree, and my children were both truly happy to receive the latest cool gadget as a gift.  Of course, the fact that it wasn't an iPod made them even more intrigued, as they actually have something that is NOT the same as all the other kids.  So far so good.They unwrapped the boxes and removed the Zunes from their packaging.  Whats not to love about the device and its fantastic design and interface.  Nothing....  a truly wondrous gadget.Now for the bad part of the review.....So I like Microsoft just fine.  Their stuff works well, just like most stuff from the major manufacturers out there, if you spend enough time with it, you can usually get as much out of it as the engineers put into it.My kids use everything from Winamp to iTunes to Windows media player to listen to music from our huge music library (over 40,000 songs, thank you Amazon for no DRM).  What I was not prepared for, and I should have known better, was that Microsoft in their infinite wisdom, would require YET ANOTHER piece of media software to make their beautiful new hardware work properly.  Enter the Zune software for the PC.Now then, Windows Media Player has been around forever, and it works fine (not my fave, but it does work fine).  It is mature, well developed, and reliable.  I had stupidly assumed that it would work fine with the Zune, but NOOOO.  I felt my stomach starting to turn.Well, I swallowed hard, and installed the Zune software on the my kids PCs.  Another massive blob of software...  a painful start down the path of Zuneland...After installing the Zune software, I spent another several hours trying to get it to run, with lots of error messages, service settings, and other dumb and silly \"security\" configurations to make.  We have successfully used Vista for several years (no, its not that bad once you tame it) and I foolishly assumed that it would just accept Zuneware:  WRONG.  In order to tame Vista, you need to shut off lots of \"features\" and \"security\" things that have zero value.  Well, the Zuneware likes many of these things, so it took some time to arrange everything so Zuneware would run.  Eventually, it ran and only crashed the system every few hours (FYI, we have had exceptional reliability from Vista, across over a dozen machines, both laptops and desktops, as well as home theater PCs), so the Zuneware introduced unreliability, which really turned my already turning stomach.Now to try the first sync, or whatever was supposed to happen.  It took another 4 hours to get the machine and the Zuneware to actually see the Zune HD.  Copious reboots, uninstalls, reinstalls, USB port swapping, etc, etc, and finally, the stars aligned and the Zune was seen by the Zuneware.  Success... at least I thought so.Now I read the ramblings of a forthcoming Microsoft product manager from the Zune group about why they felt they needed yet more software for the Zune.  Something to do with the \"customer experience\", yeah, whatever.  Mine is terrible.Now to try and use the tooty fruity Zuneware, was yet another adventure.  For some reason, some genius at Microsoft decided that they would make the Zuneware work COMPLETELY differently from any other media software out there.  Cudos for trying to be different, but the Zuneware is just plain BAAAAD, no make the AWFUL.  It took nearly a day to load our music (stored on a windows home server), and then, trying to arrange it so you could move it onto the Zune, well that was another unnatural act.Suffice it to say, I could spend another 1000 words describing the absolutely delightful (NOT) experience interacting with Zuneware, but I'll spare you, the innocent reader, from more of my diatribe.  In short, the Zuneware is yet another insidious virus like software that weaves its way into your system and won't let go.  It is incredibly painful to organize your media, and then even worse to move it back and forth to the Zune.  Basically, it just sucks.And to add insult to injury, our genius friends at Microsoft do not allow Mass Storage mode for the Zune, it doesn't appear as a flash memory device, like every other phone, MP3 player, USB device, etc on the PLANET (ie, you can't just load it with YOUR music, you MUST use the Zuneware)What is the most tragic thing here, is that the Zune HD device itself, is absolutely BRILLIANT, but is ruined by the ludicrous Zuneware.Finally, the biggest barometer.. my teenage daughters.  Now these kids are pretty self sufficient with technology.  But the $200 Zune HDs just sit there.  They don't use them.  Ever.  The Zuneware is just so annoying, unnecessary, and horrible, that they just don't care anymore to engage in the wrestling match to try and get it to work with the Zune.  For the record, its NOT the Zune device itself, but the Zuneware on the PC that my kids just HATE HATE HATE.  They just won't bother with it any more.In conclusion, if you've made it this far in my maniacal rantings, you probably have a decent idea of our experience with the glorious yet stillborn Zune HD.  I am now selling our Zune HDs, and will seek out another device for my teenagers.If Microsoft would enable regular mass storage mode, so we could use ANY media player software, then I'm sure the teenagers would have loved the Zune HDs, but as it stands now, the Zuneware ruined a perfectly good device.

Down loading the manual from the Kodak website was easy.  The manual said not to use alkaline batteries, or any other cheap battery.  It said to use LI or NIMH batteries. But, mine continues to work with good quality alkaline batteries.  Also, the Kodak site has a \"firmwear update\" for this camera, and instructions on how to download it.

They worked modestly well a half dozen times.  Then they failed to turn on and stopped working.  I text messaged a technician on the Sony website about the problem.  Zachery said that it was mandatory to use a Sony brand AAA battery replacement.  This is hogwash because all AAA batteries have the same dimensions, amps and voltage.  The MDR-NC6 was a waste of money.So, like a fool, I bought Sony Noise Canceling Headphones Model MDRNC8/BSAM at Wal-Mart for $49 plus tax.  They are a $49 pair of ear muffs.  It produced zero noise reduction in a variety of environments.  Yes, the LED light was on, indicating the instrument worked.  But no, it didn't work, so I got a refund.  The only thing they do is keep your ears warm.Perhaps it was a fluke and I got a bad set, so I found the same Sony model at Radio Shack.  The salesman worked with me on the issue.  We took another brand new MDRNC8 out of a sealed package, inserted a battery, made sure it worked and tried to hear if the thing actually cancelled noise.  And since I have a slight hearing deficit, it was good to have a young man with great hearing confirm my findings.  It didn't work.  It is supposed to reduce ambient noise 90%.  It doesn't.  I was glad not to have to return another set.  (BTW, Radio Shack's price as $39.)Finally I tried on a set of Audio-Technica ATH-ANC27 Headphones.  They cost $107 with tax.  They worked!  Excellent.

I was looking to replace my failed Roku Soundbridge with an all in one solution (The Roku required a separate amplifier), and decided that I wanted to try the newest Squeezebox radio.  The good: Easy to set-up and use (Particularly as I already had the Squeezebox account), and a great user interface.  The bad: Sound, no remote (can be added as an option), and no user documentation.This sounds like a tabletop clock radio with virtualy no stereo imaging. It is advertised as a stereo radio, but I'm not hearing it.  Even my older Alurateck internet radio has better imaging. What bass there is is muddy and the radio sounds rather tinny.  There are NO TONE adjustments, so there is not real solution.  There are no Line-out connections to hook it up to an external amplifier, though there is an earphone jack.  The audio is clear (it is still digital), but it is a major step down from the Boombox.The user inteface is a major step-up from the boombox.  The separate volume know is a definite improvement - the use of the large know on the boombox leads to inadvertent menu selections when you were trying to change the volume.  The inclusion of presets is a great plus - you press a preset and it turns the radio on to the source (channel) you selected whether it be a playlist from your personal music collection, a Pandora station, or an internet radio station.  The alarm is a little more complex with at least three levels of menus, but you can have multiple alrms for different times on different days, and individually enable them (if you dig through the menus) or just turn them all on/off at the top alarm menu level. One disappointment is that there is no way to select different stations or presets for the different alarms.  The radio comes on and plays whatever you were last listening to.  Having the graphic display is really nice.  It is bright and generally easy to read, though it does auto dim - to much if you want to read the clock in the dark.  I haven't found a way to adjust it.In summary, if you want a great clock radio that will play Pandora, internet radio or stream music from your library this is a great solution, but it will sound like a mono clock radio. If you are looking for beter sound, the boom box is well worth the extra money.

(Unlike some which use odd ball battery packs).CONS: Software (Had some issues, read below), the amount of time it takes the mouse to be \"discovered\" by the USB receiver, succeptible to RF interference. (In strong RF fields, like those near a directional AM station, it can hiccup, but thats rare).Software. DO NOT INSTALL THE SOFTWARE THAT COMES WITH THE MOUSE IF YOU USE A LAPTOP. The software is clumsy, but even worse, it overrites some DLL files in a laptop needed to control the touchpad. If you don't mind not having loony features like one click ctrl+alt , etc., just install the USB reader and let Windows discover and install the mouse.

After that I just needed to enable the speaker with a few clicks in my Mac settings and I was set.  From start to finish installation and configuration took me about 30 seconds.  Since the speaker is powered by the laptop, there's no need to worry about batteries.  The clip is nicely padded so you won't have to worry that it will damage your laptop.When the speaker is not in use you can store it in the nice little drawstring storage bag that was included.

These are almost a normal wear and tear item anymore.  Almost all of them are rather cheaply made with a limited life span.  They are subject to heat and dust.  The cooling fans seem to fail on a regular basis, which causes the power supply to overheat and fail.  They are prone to lightning strikes and other power surges; and sometimes the internal components simply fail without warning.  Over the years, I have replaced dozens for myself and clients.  How long will yours last?  No telling.  You could take a power surge tomorrow and it's gone.  That being said, I leave my computer running 24/7 so power supply failure after so many hours is more common for me.  When they go, I just replace the power supply.  An exception is when they take a power surge or an internal component other than the fan fails.  In all instances where this has happened to me, damage was done to other components of my computer and professional service is required for most users.That being said, how good will this one be?  Probably as good as any and maybe better given the ball bearing fan.  Logisys is a known brand name.  Use power surge protection as much as possible.  Hope for the best as far as internal component failure (other than the fan) is concerned.  If you turn your computer off and on, your success rate may be better than mine although there are other issues connected to turning a computer off and on which are beyond this review.So basically, what can you expect for a $20 component subjected to a lot of heat, dust, and power variations?

This thing is so hot, even Paris Hilton couldn't say, \"That's hot.\"  I'd fry eggs on it but the keys keep getting in the way of the spatula.The single large fan in the center of this product pushes air up to the bottom of the laptop.  I'd prefer to be able to direct it to the bottom LEFT side where the nuclear core is, but no re-positioning possible.  It took a minute to find the speed control, it's a small thumb wheel on the right side.  Thinking the fan was not spinning very fast, I went to turn up the speed, only to realize it was already on it's highest setting.  Dang.One major drawback is the USB plug that powers it.  Standard USB plugs are about 1 1/2 long of plug, plastic, and wire protector before it turns into plain cable.  The USB ports on the HP DV7 are on the sides, nearer to the front of the laptop.  That means if I plug in the fan to the USB port on the right side, I have this long USB plug sticking out near my hand.  I quickly found out that transitioning from mouse handling to keyboard typing, I was knocking this plug sticking out.Why do USB plugs have to stick straight out from the computer like porcupine quills?  Why aren't there L-shaped plugs that can follow the contour?I decided to move the plug to the left side of the laptop, only to realize the supplied cord is a few inches too short.  The USB on the fan unit connects at the top-right corner, near the power switch.  I could not run the cable around the back of the laptop and up into the left side.  I finally settled on having to run the cable UNDER unit, which made it awkward when sitting on a flat surface.  I finally ran the USB cable BETWEEN the fan and the laptop, and that seems to work out.The product says it can accommodate a 17\" laptop.  Mine is a 17\" laptop and I'll tell you that this fan barely fits underneath.  The laptop overhangs the fan about 3/4\" on left/right sides.  That means I have to keep my legs closer together to keep the fan unit on my lap.  Additionally, there are 2 nice rubber feet on the backside of the fan to keep it from slipping off a table.  But when placed on your lap, you can feel them slightly digging into your legs.The blue LED on the fan does not really light anything up and not noticeable when your sitting at your laptop, even in a dark room.Overall:Heat control: averageStability: goodLap Compatible: poor", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Medium Rare", "unixReviewTime": 1326585600, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2012"}

Because of the way the room is designed, I needed to correct this issue to ensure better sound from my old JVC receiver...had it for about 18 years.Anyway, I hooked the two front speakers to the amp and then used a cable to connect the phones receivers output to the amp's CD input. This worked wonderfully. I get to change the volume to the front speakers and adjust bass and travel directly through the amp. The JVC receiver stills deliver power to the rear speakers, but I can lower the volume down while using the amp to raise the volume to the front speakers.It also has a mic input. I hooked a mic and can sing along while playing my favorite tune...the mic has separate volume. I have not tried the USB port, but if it works is just another extra bonus.

Most importantly, it works perfectly--it holds the iPad in all three positions, both horizontally and vertically and sleeps/wakes the iPad as it should.  It does have a bit of a textile smell, but I think this will dissipate over time.  The included stylus also works well and has a pen on the opposite end, which is convenient.

I still think it's a great bargain, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one, but I wanted to note that the first slot no longer holds the iPad as it did initially. I had folded the front cover all the way back behind the back cover, and after that, the \"joint\" was no longer stiff enough to hold the weight of the iPad in the first slot.

The directions that came with my keyed Kensington Laptop lock were the briefest of generic directions applicable to most keys & Laptops. But they were missing a very important step in the installation. The directions simply say, \"Insert the lock and turn it 90 degrees \" to secure it. However the Lock, as packaged requires  preparation before installation that is not noted in the directions. What they fail to tell you is that the lock must be lengthened using the most miniscule and fragile  Allen wrench that I have ever used in my life. The directions only mention the Allen wrench as a means to tighten the lock after you have inserted & turned the lock in the lock port. Nowhere is it mentioned that the lock must be lengthened  to its longest point before it can be turned those 90 degrees in the Laptop. I wasted 45 minutes trying manipulation and experimentation with the only result being that I became more & more frustrated. It was pure luck that I managed to get the lock installed on my Laptop after trying numerous possible solutions.Kensington needs to add the simple but necessary instructions to, \"lengthen the stem of the lock\"  before inserting it into the lock port. That will save folks like me a lot of heartburn.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Lock  works Great if you can figure out how to install it with the limited directions provided", "unixReviewTime": 1325808000, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2012"}

It does everything without even ever having to press the CABLE or DVD buttons! the software is easy to use and once you pick out your devices within the software you can select from the complete list of commands each device has.Once I press \"Watch TV\", both my TV and receiver power on and everything is mapped to my TV except for the volume which is mapped to my receiver, which is perfect.

I have absolutely no need to use my original TV or receiver remote for anything... I can bring up and navigate through all of my TV's menus just like I can with the original remote.In the rare times that I need it, I also set it up so that if I hit the DVD button the first 2 colored buttons are then tied to the 2 inputs I use on my receiver.

For those who don't know, neutral density filters reduce the amount of light coming through the lens. With an ND filter, you cn reduce the light, so you can use a slower exposure and blur that waterfall you're photographing. It looks a like more like a waterfall if the falling water isn't frozen in time and space. Likewise, let's say you're photographing a street scene - use a ND filter and the shoppers hurrying along become blurred, adding a dynamic element to the scene. By the way, you'll generally want to use a tripod or monopod when shooting with ND filters.This ND filter is adjustable through a range of NF number 2 through 400, which is quite remarkable. That's a range of 8 f-stops.  It sure beats having to carry several ND filters and fumbling for the one you want.There is no question that these are inexpensive filters. The nearest competitor is twice as costly. These filters are multi-coated instead of single-coated.I've only been able to put them to limited use so far, because it is winter in Chicago and I am not doing much outdoor photography.But so far, my limited tests have been encouraging. The adjustment ring slides smoothly and stays in place. I've noticed no color shifts (something that would be typical with inexpensive filters). Vignetting on a 28mm digital camera lens is moderately severe at 28mm, but disappears between 35 - 50mm.

{"reviewerID": "A2240J73FTPR21", "asin": "B009PK9S90", "reviewerName": "Robert C.", "helpful": [7, 11], "reviewText": "Let me start off this review by stating that I have many years of experience with electronic devices, computers and cameras under my belt.  I was working in multimedia before the phrase \"multimedia\" was coined.  That said, I feel I am more than qualified to review the GoPro Hero3.  But I'm not going to focus on what has already been covered in countless reviews.  You've also likely already seen footage shot with a GoPro, so you know what kind of camera this is and what it's geared towards.  120 FPS in 720p, etc.  So I'm going to focus in on some details I feel that GoPro got wrong.  Very wrong.I'll start off with the packaging.  I've had experience unpacking many, many, many, many electronic and computer devices in my life.  It took me literally a half an hour to fully, carefully de-box this thing.  The package itself is clearly geared towards a retail point-of-sales display, with the camera packaged in its own tough, clear plastic display case atop an almost empty photo laden cardboard box tower.  I discovered that the plastic box is attached to the cardboard box with four points of black, double-sided, sticky, rubber-foot-like-feet and clear tape round the perimeter.  Not only is this entire display case design completely excessive and wasteful, there is no clue given as to how to de-box the thing on the package itself.  So you're left to figure out how the camera that resides in the plastic display on top is attached to the rest of the box without it accidentially falling or flying out onto the floor or across the room in a fit of rage since all you want to do is get your shiny new camera out of this ridiculous box.  Then, once you manage to get the plastic box open, the camera is attached to the bottom of that plastic box with wires.  Not plastic ties.  Not thin, twisty ties covered in black plastic.  Wires.  Threaded through holes.  Get out the pliers.  This all seems very excessive if not downright stupid for what could have been accomplished with a small cardboard box and cardboard packing inserts, especially considering that the vast majority of these cameras will likely be sold online.For $400, there is no manual in the big, stupid box.  Just four squares of useless printed material directing you to update the firmware and download the pdf manual.  The pdf manual that exists online is horrible.  It is not at all comprehensive.  It does not walk you through your initial setup.  It is not much of anything except reference material.  Also included are some basic mounts, the wireless remote and a short mini usb cable.So, being the good little tech nerd that I am, I decided to go ahead and update the firmware as advised by one of those four pieces of paper generously included in the box which explains how crucial it is to update the firmware immediately, or apparently the world may in fact end if you try to use the Hero3 before updating.  This begins the waste of the next two hours of my life.  There is a step-by-step guide online for updating the firmware.  This is great except in my case, it didn't work.  A quick Google search will reveal that many, many people have issues with the GoPro update system.  So I had to do the \"manual\" update, which wasn't really described or documented well at all and it involves copying the contents of a zip file generated only after you answer an online questionnaire to the root of the microsd card you're using and restarting the camera.  After all the hub-bub and a few tries at the automatic update and then a few tries of the manual update, including one extremely fun point where the camera completely froze up during a manual update attempt and I had to physically remove the battery to continue - which risked bricking the thing, it turns out that my GoPro Hero3 already had the current firmware.  A fact that could have easily been figured out had GoPro simply listed the current firmware version prominently on their website.  But they don't.  See, when you turn the Hero3 on, it displays the current firmware version it has right on it's little LCD screen.  On the website, they just give a firmware date, but no version number.  Nice.  Thank you GoPro for that thoughtful insight.Onto the hardware.  First of all, it is a seemingly well made little device.  It has to be to survive all of the stunts people attempt with it!  But there are a few obvious design misses.  For one thing, it has a mini-usb port instead of a micro-usb port.  I haven't seen a new device that uses a mini-usb port for about two years.  How in heck could they go with a mini instead of a micro?  Everything is using micro usb nowadays.  But not the Hero3.  Nope.  The Hero3 will require you to carry around another cable or adapter to charge it or attach it to your computer.  Also the interface on this thing is reminiscent of early 1990's era pagers.  It is not user friendly at all.  It is very confusing and I can see that it would be very easy to set it up incorrectly.  I'm sure there have been many miserable people who do crazy things on camera after they thought they had it set up a certain way only to find it wasn't set up that way at all and the footage didn't come out right or at all as a result.Luckily, there is an app for that.  Since the GoPro Hero3 Black Edition acts as its own Wi-Fi source, once you set the Wi-Fi source name and security up on the Hero3, you simply add it to your iOS or Android device as another Wi-Fi network and point your device to it.  There is a GoPro app for both iOS and Android.  I have an Android phone - A most excellentLG Optimus G.  The app is definitely not the slickest, but it does allow you to change most settings without having to use the pager interface on the GoPro Hero3 itself.  It also has the ability to preview some (but not all) of the live video modes directly to the phone on about a two or three second delay (in my case, I suppose that may vary with different hardware or in different conditions).  This is great for aiming the device or making sure certain settings are set the way you want them.  You can also use it to start and stop recording.  It does not allow you to playback recorded video.  It does not allow you to preview any of the high-framerate modes, which I can understand, but I don't see why it couldn't just send every other frame when in that mode, or every fourth frame, for instance, and still give you a preview.  However, I recommend that once you have the camera set up and aimed, that you turn off the Wi-Fi completely on the Hero3 for a serious recording run as the Wi-Fi eats battery so you'll have to start/stop recording manually.And speaking of batteries, if you do go with a Hero3, I highly recommend that you also pick up aWasabi battery pack and charger.  The Hero3 does eat batteries if you're recording a lot, especially if you use the Wi-Fi, and charging the battery in camera, sucks.  The Wasabi pack gives you two high-quality, Japanese cell, essentially OEM spec batteries and an external charger which charges via AC or cigarette lighter in vehicle.  All for a very fair price.BTW, I'm using aSamsung Pro 64GB Micro SDXC UHS-Icard in mine.  I've had no problems recording anything.  I have heard that some people have had issues with Sandisk cards in their Hero3.  Most of the Sandisk cards are slower than the Samsung Pro card, so that may be the reason.Other thoughts...I think for the money, they could have included more mounts in the box.  They sell separate kits for mounts.  The mounts are very cheap and flimsy (compared to professional camera mounts), so IMO, they could have included them all.  Especially annoying is the lack of a simple suction cup mount in the box.  Nope.  Gotta buy it separately.IMO, the remote control they include with the black edition is rudimentary and really only useful if you're not planning on using an Android or iOS device to control the unit with.  For a lot of people, like myself, I would rather have had more mounts included instead.  Maybe the remote would be useful in extreme conditions.Believe it or not, I do like the unit.  It does take great video!  From what I've been told by a professional cinematographer friend who has used previous generation GoPro units in the past, the GoPro Hero3 is a vast improvement.  But it is definitely not perfect.  And for $400, I expect more sensible packaging, a better manual, a better firmware update system, a better user interface and more mounts in the box.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very good, but could be a lot better", "unixReviewTime": 1373241600, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2013"}

I've read that this card has no problems working in said device, so I decided to give it a try. Worst case, I could put it in the laptop and use it as some extra storage.The card arrived in real retail packaging, and as far as I can tell, is a genuine Sandisk product. Included were some coupons for music downloads (in the trash) and an SD-to-microSD adapter. No problems there.This card won't work as-is. It comes formatted with a new version of FAT, called exFAT. This allows the OS to take advantage of the card's size while providing an across the board file system for devices. To the best of my knowledge, the only difference between XC and HC is the file system - the card itself has the same electrical interface.To make this card work, you'll need a couple of things. A machine with either a SD card reader, or an external dongle device, and some programs. Windows will no longer format drives larger than 32GB, even with the command line trick. So, search for a fat32 formatter program. I used fat32format from Ridgecrop Consultants, Ltd. It's a free command line program, and only does one thing. Search for it and you'll find it on the first page of results.After the card was formatted, I installed it into the phone and booted, and checked the SD card. 59.4GB! Yes! I formatted it again on the phone to make sure everything was good, and copied the files from my old card over. No problems, and I have something like 40GB left.If you're lucky, your phone will format this card direct. Mine wouldn't. I keep the fat32format program on the card now, just in case.So, in conclusion:Works fine on a Sensation with Gingerbread 2.3.4, firmware 1.50.Format it on a computer first, use a fat32 formatterSeems legit, running for a week now with no issues.Speed?

I use the stand quite a bit so, for me, that's a definite plus.~The elastic-strap closure is very convenient.~Nice looking.Cons:~As other reviewers have noted, the corner elastic straps that secure the device inside the cover do partially block the speakers.  For those who use headphones or an external speaker all the time this won't be an issue.  I'm not sure how the design could be changed to avoid this drawback.  It may be a necessary trade-off but perhaps the designers can come up with an alternative system for future generations of the product.~Adds weight and bulk to the device.  The cover makes the device heavier and bulkier to carry.  Again, this becomes a personal choice as to how much protection you want vs. a lighter-weight cover.  For me, the extra protection, functionality, and appearance are worth it.~The corner straps are difficult to get on the Fire so the case pretty much becomes a permanent part of the device.

So many times birds fly right on top of my head or come too close. If I was sitting there with fixed 500mm, I would have to just sit there and wait and hope the bird goes where I can get focus.

It is only 5.6f with 400mm however even that produces beautiful creamy backgrounds. For any photography the background is important but it is even more important for wildlife.

Wilder", "helpful": [52, 60], "reviewText": "I have an early-2008 Mac Pro and I recently suffered a power outage while Time Machine was doing a backup to an internal disk, and as a result my backup disk got irreparably corrupted.  So my purpose for getting a UPS is to be able to gracefully shutdown in the event of a power outage.  APC's web site made it sound easy... OS-X 10.5+ have built in support for USB UPS's... it just works!  Not quite.  It only appears to work until tested further.When I plugged the USB into my Mac I was initially quite impressed that the UPS controls immediately showed up in the Energy Saver preferences.  I was a little disappointed that some of the functionality was lacking, such as the remaining run time, but I could live with that since the percentage of batter left seemed accurate.Next I began simulating events by pulling the UPS plug out of the wall.  Next issue was the Mac Pro's power supply buzzed on battery power.  This is because these non-Smart UPS's simulate the AC waveform in low-resolution steps.  I didn't want to pay twice as much for a true since wave, so this was just another annoyance I could live with.  However, I've read that some newer power supplies don't work at all with the stepped output, so be sure to do your own research on that.Next I timed a shutdown in the middle of a Time Machine backup to make sure it was graceful.  It wasn't graceful.  OS-X does a hard shutdown and my backup disk got irreparably corrupted again.  I verified this repeatedly on both Leopard and Snow Leopard.  This was upsetting since this was the whole point of the UPS.  This isn't a problem with the UPS, though, so not ready to return it yet, and began researching software alternatives.However, in my repeated testing I find another major issue.  OS-X and UPS stop communicating after only a couple events (1-4).  Rebooting the computer or unplugging and replugging the USB cable gets it going again.  Since most power events would probably result in the computer being restarted anyway, this issue could go unnoticed in practice.  However, if folks have brown-outs or outages under a few minutes then this could again defeat one of the main reasons to have a UPS.In trying to determine if this was an Apple problem or an APC problem, I connected the UPS to a Windows XP machine I have and installed the PowerChute software.  Verdict: it's an Apple problem.  I simulated over a dozen events on the Windows machine and it kept going like a champ.  The PowerChute software also reports all the status information accurately and seems to work really well.  For the first time ever I was a bit envious of the PC.But that didn't last long because I found some better software for the Mac... apcupsd.  This is not for the faint of heart as it's a complicated unix program designed for IT pros.  However, there's a nice binary installation package for OS-X on the [...] website and it works pretty well right out of the box.  It has a GUI agent that has all the status info reported by the UPS (a lot more than even PowerChute had).  To make modifications to the settings, such as when to shutdown you have to edit a text file as root.  This means you have to be familiar with sudo and vi commands.  You can also customize what happens on any of a large number of events by editing files with names equal to the event.  I modified each one to send mail to my Blackberry.  I also made a simple modification to unmount my backup disks when going on battery.  I did this, because even though apcupsd does a graceful shutdown command, Time Machine still created some minor corruption.  Although the corruption was easily reparable with Disk Utility, I felt this still wasn't good enough, and Time Machine does seem robust against disk unmounts/ejects in the middle of a backup.  I also verified that apcupds never lost communication with UPS over many simulated events and time.  And if it did lose communication, there's an event for that, so it will send me mail, and not just silently ignore the UPS like OS-X.I should mention I also investigated a piece of software called PowerSaveUPS.  It's pretty full-featured and very nice, including 2-level shutdown (graceful, then emergency).  However, 1) it's expensive, and 2) it still had the same communication problem as OS-X.So now I am pretty happy with this UPS since I can do everything I want to do, and don't think there is anything better for the money.  And even though the 2 main gripes I had with it seem to be OS-X and Time Machine faults, I'm still deducting stars from APC for claiming Mac compatibility when in reality it was extremely difficult to get it set up to be as reliable and graceful as it ought to be.  I think they have a responsibility to put more effort on that.On another note, this UPS has a feature where it will cut power to some sockets based on the current draw of a master socket.  The idea is when your computer is asleep it will cut power to peripherals.  This sounds nice in theory, and is how they get away with slapping a big sticker on that says it will save you $150/yr in energy costs.  However, in practice it doesn't make much sense to plug much in there.  I can't plug my monitor there because these sockets are not battery backed, so I wouldn't be able to see to close my files in an outage.  I also don't want to put my printer there, because when my office computer is sleeping, we still may want to print over wifi from laptops.  In the end, then only thing I found I could put there is my powered speakers.  And I don't think that's going to save me anywhere near $150/yr.For your reference, my 8-core Mac Pro with 30\" monitor draws 320W at idle, as such this UPS supplies 17 min. of backup power.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Mac compatibility lacking", "unixReviewTime": 1266537600, "reviewTime": "02 19, 2010"}

I purchased a blue one during a Black Friday sale for roughly $35 and two red ones for about $30 each. At those prices, they were a great bargain.When you first get your powerbag, it is important to open the battery pouch and remove the small plastic on the battery pack. You can easily remove the battery by shifting a button that locks the battery in. Upon removing the plastic, your powerbag will now be able to charge through a small port located on the external front side of the powerbag. The powerbag charger is also located inside the battery pouch (I usually store the the AC adapter in the left pouch). The instructions provided within the powerbag are great and you shouldn't have a problem setting it up.When the battery is being charged, you will see blinking LED lights on the front surface of the powerbag. A single click of the powerbag button will indicate the battery level. A long press press (2-3 seconds) will begin charging your device or stop charging your device.The backpack itself is very spacious. There is a pouch that faces the back for laptops (or other flat things that can rest comfortably on your back). My 15-inch MacBook Pro fits nicely inside this pouch. There is also another pouch for storage of regular items. I am able to fit 9 different MCAT books of various sizes and still have empty space for additional storage. There is also a pouch that contains the battery as well as slots for tablet storage, pencils, erasers, flash cards, and more.During the school year, I use my powerbag on a daily basis. The battery is sufficient to provide my iPhone with a more than substantial charge to last the whole day. There are various USB cables to charge your device as well as a USB port on the battery to connect your own.Lastly, the powerbag fits comfortably on my back.

But when they do, you can almost always expect that it will bring a lot of discussion, criticism, and praise.  The big question is if these devices are actually as good as they are made out to be.The Zune HD, released on September 15, 2009, was one of Microsoft's most recently anticipated devices.  It brought many new features to distinguish itself from the competition.  A few of those include Nvidia's Tegra chip and an OLED screen.  All of these sound good on paper, but how well are they implemented in the Zune HD.Appearance - The Zune is a very appealing device.  Contrary to many devices that go for a smooth vibe, the HD takes on a design that involves many lines and gives off a boxy feel but also sleek at the same time.  It also has some subtle accents, like the silver screws in the back, or the brushed chrome back that make it look different than any other device on the market.Ease of Use - The user interface of the Zune is fairly straightforward.  It uses gestures to navigate its menu system, and they work very well.  When you start it up, you are presented with a list of choices, including Music, Videos, Pictures, and others.  Also, if you flick your finger to the side, you can see a list of items that you have marked as your favorite, or the newest thing you added to your device.  A very useful feature when you want something fast.  But there are some downsides.  Occasionally, the Zune will not recognize button presses.  This does not usually hinder you, but it does get annoying really fast.Features - Another place where the Zune stands out and shines.  One of the biggest and most obvious features of the Zune HD is its OLED screen.  It makes colors pop and images displayed on it look flawless, especially in low light.  The only problem I have with the OLED is that it gets washed out in sunlight.  But if you can get past that small weakness, you will have one of the best screens in your hand.  Also, the Tegra chip in the Zune is impressive.  It can run a full 3D racing game with nice looking textures and many objects on screen without any sign of a choppy picture.  The HD radio is nice, too, because with it, you can access many new stations that you would not normally be able to listen to without it.  But there always must also be some weak points.  One of those would be the Zune's selection of apps.  There is no app store that includes user made apps, and the ones that are in the store are all free but boot up with an add.  But the Zune was made as to be a media player, and it excels at that in every aspect.As you may have recognized by now, the Zune is one of the best devices for your personal media.  But if you are a person that needs apps, and lots of them, you have the wrong device.  For almost any other media needs, the Zune will meet and even surpass your expectations.  And with all of the features you get in such a small package, you won't find a better looking device anywhere.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Good Multimedia Player", "unixReviewTime": 1272412800, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2010"}

I have Verizon FiOS, which allows self-installation of CableCARDs, and they documented it very well.  There's even a web page where YOU get to type the HostID and DeviceID...so you'll know it's right.  Other CableCos require truck-rolls ($40+) for installation, and the technicians know nothing.  Often, they will use a default HostID at the central office, meaning it won't work, so you have to become a literal cable expert to get it working, and do the cable company's job...on your dime.  So, with that out of the way...I had started with the ATI CableCARD tuner, which was state-of-the-art when it came out in 2006.  There were so many restrictions with it, though.  For example, you had to buy a complete CableLabs certified computer to even legally obtain one.  Eventually, bootloaders to spoof the BIOS key came out, and you could get these ATI tuners on Ebay and use them.  Legal?  Grey area.  Immoral?  Nope, as long as you pay for cable and the channels you get.  When Windows7 came out, the whole \"CableLabs certified computer\" requirement was thrown out, and Microsoft added support for Switched Digital Video.  If your Cableco uses SDV, you need another box, and it is another minor headache to set up.  But, if you successfully set up your CableCARD already, it's not hard.  FiOS doesn't use SDV, which is good.Now, with the advent of Windows7, the environment was open enough to where other companies could have a viable business developing CableCARD tuners.  ATI sold off that business as the market wasn't viable in the Vista days, but 3 more entrants have come in, including SiliconDust with this product.The setup of the HDHomeRun was really simple.  The directions were excellent, and short.  Verizon did well with the CableCARD activation, and when that was done, the setup was easy.  I'd recommend just downloading the updated software from SiliconDust...something I've just always done for the last decade.  Windows Media Center recognized the 3 tuners without a hitch (plus 2 more ClearQAM tuners I have), and my literal first attempt at tuning an alternate Showtime channel was successful.If you have to use SDV, the SDV box can plug into the HDHomeRun.  This means it's \"always active\" which is a good thing.  With the other solutions, but the tuner and SDV adapter are plugged into your computer's ports (internal or external), and that means the SDV adapter is not directly connected to the tuner.  While it works, I had found that first-time SDV-channel tuning wasn't always trouble-free; I often had to change channels and change back to get a SDV channel working.  This made the Sunday HBO/Showtime recording a question-mark, and often it had to record the program on another day.  With the HDHomeRun, this should occur less often as the SDV Adapter is connected at all times.  Word of warning...make sure your CableCo's SDV box will support 4 channels.  If your cableCo uses a Cisco box, it may be limited to 2 channels...and your HDHomeRun will be, too.The HDHomeRun also uses Gigabit ethernet.  I highly recommend you use a gigabit switch.  While each channel is only 20Mbps or so, that means that 3 will fit into a 100Mbps connection.  But, if you are using this to record 3 channels and watch recordings on other devices (such as an Xbox360) or other computers at the same time, a 100Mbps connection could be overwhelmed causing quality loss at best or corrupted recodings at worst.  Good gigabit switches are cheap.  My Cisco/Linksys 8-port handles this well.  I would not recommend using this with WiFi.  At best you could record 1 channel or watch one program...and not at the same time.  Perhaps if you use 5Ghz Wifi, you may get away with more, but WiFi isn't very good for streaming HD video.In conclusion, this device is a great buy!  I have a 7TB DVR that can record 5 (3 from this plus 2 ClearQAM) channels at one time, and support TVs in other rooms via Xbox360 extenders.  This thing can replace multiple cable boxes.  If you have a 3 TV household, it could save you almost $50 per MONTH in rental fees (assuming 3 DVRs).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very easy setup!

I had called Actiontec prior to the purchase to ask about the compatibility with a DishNet VIP 622 DVR receiver and it was not on their approved or checked list as of yet.  The DishNet receivers that they said it did work with were the 222K, 722K and the 922 Duo.  Took a gamble that if had worked on those it had the potential to work on mine plus my next receiver will be either the 722K or 922.Well it turns out it does work with the DishNet VIP622 DVR.  I did not have to do the firmware update to make this happen however prior to installation I once again called tech support to ask about it.  They said if I didn't have a picture when installed I would definitely have to do the upgrade but if the picture was good then don't worry about it.One thing that puzzled the heck out of me once I started the installation was following their directions I disconnected the HDMI cable from the back of my satellite receiver but then I noticed that this was no ordinary HDMI cable.  DishNet has a connection ( couple of pieces about 2\" x  2\" and flat) on that HDMI cable which performs a function for which I have no idea and I haven't called DishNet to find out.  I made the decision to make that cable be the one that runs from the satellite receiver into the Actiontec Transmitter and then I used the Actiontec HDMI cable to go from the Transmitter to the nearby HD TV.So the good news is that once I had everything hooked up and had my second HD TV on the proper HDMI input I had picture and sound.  For about a minute I had some pixlation and a small pop in the sound and those both went away and after having it hooked up now for several hours and watching a variety of channels I have not seen anything but an excellent picture and sound. To be honest I couldn't even figure out what the remote control from Actiontec was for and my kit didn't have any instructions except for the laminated and folded quick set up guide.  I went online and printed out the 34 page full instruction manual and then used the Actiontec remote control through the GUI graphical user interface on the second HD TV to see how strong my signal was.  Lowest signal strength was shown and yet great picture.  Theater mode was already selected which is what I would have selected and auto on the wireless channel to be used was already selected so really I could have never used the remote control and it wouldn't have mattered.Where I have my second HD TV we use the provided DishNet UHF remote control to change channels on the satellite receiver and so I did not need to hook up the IR extender cables etc.The distance between Transmitter and Receiver in my case is about 50 feet in a straight line with one wall although there is a large hallway which probably allows the wireless signal to be tranmitted.  I purchased this product primarily for use in a fifth wheel trailer that we have ordered because the satellite receiver will sit approximately 15 feet from the HD TV set and the dealer was talking about trying to run a HDMI cable if I really wanted HD TV instead of standard definition.  Since I am putting a DishNet Travelr 1000 on the trailer I know I will be getting full HD and want to see that on the HD TV.  We had used the Dish Net Travelr 1000 on a previous trailer with great luck but in that case the satellite receiver and TV were co-located. I am making an assumption that in the fifth wheel trailer the signal strength to the Actiontec Receiver will be stronger due to less distance plus interior walls in a trailer are quite thin.So now I can watch a full HD picture on a TV that previously has been fed standard definition signal.  Huge difference and so worth it.  One oddity that I have discovered is that on our primary HD TV located near the Transmitter the volume has changed.  Say before we might have had the volume at a level of 25 now the volume is at a level of 10 to produce the same sound level.  I suspect that the powered Transmitter possibly boosts the signal but don't know that for sure and don't care.This is a relatively new product to the market but it fills a need I have and I think they have done a decent job with it.  Customer support has been easy to get a live human on the line.  If I experience any problems I will revisit this review for updates.Okay one day later and there is an update to review.  I had a small problem that I didn't even know I had.  With my DishNet system I had to power on the satellite receiver first and then the primary TV or the one closest to the MyWireless Transmitter.  Called support and was advised that a firmware update would resolve.  Had to buy a thumb drive.  Got a 4GB one which was overkill.  Downloaded the update which was really quite simple.  Performed the update after watching the online video.  Very simple. Okay so everything works but here is the really odd part.  If the satellite receiver is off and I turn the Sony TV on with the Sony TV remote I will get this grey/blank screen.  I then have to turn off the TV turn off the satellite receiver and then turn on the satellite receiver first and then the TV.  If I use the DishNet remote control it seems I can turn on the TV or the receiver first and it makes no difference.  At any rate these seem to be very odd and possibly unique problems to my system.  At no time have I yet had any problem streaming full HD to the second TV.  Still happy with product.Oh yeah one last comment.  I did end up calling DishNet to inquire about the odd HDMI cable they had provided.

Aesthetically it is fairly large with a wide silicon/rubber band and a pretty generic but sporty design (I uploaded a couple of pictures to help see what it looks like when worn).  I didn't find it encumbering my motion or causing any discomfort, and the large size naturally gives the benefit of a larger, easier to read screen - a plus worth the bulk in my opinion.  I probably wouldn't choose this as my everyday watch because of the size and because the battery is rechargeable, but I like it for use on the course.  The screen is easily viewable in direct sunlight even when I'm wearing sunglasses.I live in a pretty small rural Midwestern town and was impressed to find that the only 2 real courses in my town were both already in the database for use with the WT3.  Two smaller courses in a nearby town even smaller than mine were also in the database, so the odds that your courses are good to go are high (you can always check via the maker's website).  Kudos to GolfBuddy on the comprehensive collection of courses.Satellite lock-on was quick and painless and I didn't encounter any drops or software issues.  Others have complained about the poor included instruction documentation, but I found use of the WT3 to be relatively intuitive if you're willing to do a little trial and error with the manual in hand for reference.  Don't expect to fire it up the first time and use every function and feature without some time invested in learning the device.  The WT3 seemed very accurate in its measurements.  Distances to the center, back, and front of the green are provided and seemed spot on.  The dynamic green view rotates the depiction of the green depending upon your location and angle of approach to the green to give you a better map than a simple static view.  Bunker and hazard locations are also present and accounted for.  Pin placement can be adjusted very easily to one of 9 preset locations.  I found the scorecard functionality to be easy to use, along with the shot distance feature.  All in all big thumbs up on the seamless functions on the WT3.In an ideal world I'd hope for better battery life.  The watch when fully charged will easily handle a round at any pace, but two rounds might outlast the battery depending upon pace and time between rounds.  Obviously the size of the device limits what sized battery it can take, and overall the battery life is acceptable but a little more juice would be nice.  In addition, the watch can change holes on you if your shots are bad and steer you closer to a different hole than the one you're playing.  You can fix it fairly easily by going into the menus, but it is a minor pain.Any complaints, however, don't take away much from this really powerful device.

With this in mind, I'll give you guys my impression of this premium Samsung 17\" Chronos laptop. Starting with the...Display (4.5/5):Measuring 17.3\" at 1920x1080 resolution, the display on this laptop is simply amazing. Having never owned a 1080p display laptop scren, you will appreciate the vast real estate available to you. The brightness is simply the highest among the laptops I have had the chance to own. According to an Engadget review, the brightness is measured at 300 nit. Even at lower than half brightness, your screen will feel sufficiently bright.The only negative I found was the way Samsung's driver (Samsung Easy Settings) handles the screen brightness. Although there is a setting to disable automatic brightness, on occasion the screen automatically change its brightness, whether during game play, movie viewing or web browsing. It didn't bother me too much, and it doesn't happen often enough to be a problem.Performance (4/5):The number one bottleneck for laptops nowadays is the hard drive. It's no surprise that my gripe with this laptop is inclusion of 5400RPM HDD (Samsung Brand). Although there is a mSSD cache to help boost the overall zippiness, I definitely felt the performance suffering from the lack of SSD. I would rate the performance of the laptop at (5/5) once you put the SSD. If you need help opening the back plate of the laptop, you can watch the how to on youtube:[...]Another benefit of installing SSD is the lack of hard drive noise, and the heat in the left palmrest area. Also, I don't know if this is a coincidence, but it also reduces the frequency with which the fans turn on.In terms of gaming, I can honestly say this is the laptop to get if you want to play the latest games. I play Diablo III and it runs 40-60 FPS at 1080p on high settings. The GeForce GT 650M is simply one of the hottest mobile GPU.Sound (5/5):Not much to say here. JBL speakers on this laptop gives plenty of bass and the sound is as good as if not much better than most USB speakers. Definitely better sound than any of the laptops I have owned in the past.Noise (4.5/5):If you've owned a MacBook Pro (or an Acer Aspire TimelineX), you'll know that those machines are QUIET when you're doing non-graphic intensive stuff. This laptop is the same. When you're simply browsing the web, watching Youtube videos or writing on WORD, you won't hear the fans come on.Where this laptop shines compared to the MacBook Pro is when you're playing graphic intensive games or streaming 1080p movies. MacBook Pro fans are super loud when you're doing graphic intensive work, but this laptop is still relatively quiet. It's definitely audible, but nowhere near as loud as the MacBook Pro fans.Heat (5/5):Two relatively quiet fans help dissipate heat quickly. I played Diablo III for a couple hours and the laptop was never too hot. The hottest areas were the backplate and the area near the screen, where the vents are located. Still, nowhere near as hot as MacBook Pro.Keyboard/Touchpad (2.5/5):The keyboard looks almost exactly like the one on MacBook Pro. It has backlighting, which come on when the computer detects low lighting. But like the auto screen brightness, the software is buggy and the backlighting sometimes flickers on and off with slight change in my positioning. I chose to turn off the automatic backlighting in favor of manual toggling. Other than that, the keyboard is the standard keyboard and I have no complaint.The touchpad is the most disappointing aspect of this laptop. Much like the MacBook Pro touchpad, this one also doesn't have any buttons. You can click left of the half way point and it's the left click and vice-versa. However, when you click far too right/bottom or left/bottom, the glass touchpad dips down quite a bit. It almost looks like it'll break, although I highly doubt it will. Another gripe is the ELAN driver. It has very limited settings and the tap is way too sensitive. You can't even change the tap sensitivity, and so I found myself typing and accidentally clicking someplace on the screen. It's annoying, but you can turn off the tapping and rely on clicking instead. Also, I found that having one finger near the bottom and another finger for moving the cursor sometimes results in the inability to move the cursor. You'd have to then release one or both fingers and try again.Battery life (4/5):It's rated at 7 hours, but I have been getting about 4-5 hours on Samsung optimized settings. This is not too shabby considering this is how much battery life I was getting on the MacBook Pro. (On a side note, my Acer Aspire consistently lasted me 8 hours!)In conclusion, I'll give this a thumbs up and a 4/5 score. You're basically getting the same specs sans retina display as the \"MacBook Pro 15\" with Retina\" for $600-700 less and with bigger screen.

I am an IT person that is constantly striving for maximum performance and range from my wi-fi routers at home.  I use a hardwired router for my internet access and then different routers throughout my home as wi-fi access points.  I used this router as a wi-fi access point.  My comparison for dual band is compared against the latest Apple Airport Extreme which now supports 802.11ac.  Here are my findings...short and sweet.Pros:A.  Great router which is easy to setup and configure.  I would say a novice could have this up and running for basic needs in 10-15 minutes.B.  Range:  I found the range on this router to be on par with anything else out in the market place.  It did however perform better in the 5ghz space for me.  Further testing was done by placing this router in my basement which is constructed of cinder block/concrete.  I wanted to see how the range would be from the basement to the main floor and 2nd floor of my home..not to mention the back yard, garage, etc.  Much to my surprise this router beat out the Apple product with a signal which was at about 50-65% strength (better than zero).  Enough said....C.  Features.  The entire router is gigabit...in other words the WAN or internet port and the 5 LAN ethernet ports are all gigabit which provides for maximum speed.  I do recommend that you use high quality cat 6 cables for maximum shielding.D. Features. The router (model I have) comes with 2 USB 2.0 ports for sharing drives and printers.  I tested this by sharing a removable hard drive as well as a USB 2.0 flash drive.  The speed was kind of slow on the file sharing but I would attribute that to mostly USB 2.0.  The 2nd revision of this router now supports one USB 3.0 port and that is a definite requirement these days.  None the less the 2 ports are functional and useful for day to day activities.Cons:A.  Support: I am going to start with this as I feel it is most important with any technology related product.  Netgear support is very hard to get a hold of and although they have chat options on their site, it is somewhat horrific.  I had to contact them about this device a few times and eventually got a response.....not to my liking, but a response.B. Firmware: My router required a firmware upgrade which was easy to do and solved some of the issues I was having with the device.  I was asked then, by support to do multiple upgrades.  The last upgrade failed and the router became completely unresponsive.  I then had to use TFTP software to push a firmware onto the device.  This did work.  My only opinion here is that a normal day to day user should not have to do TFTP transfers to a router to make it work.  I was able to because I am familiar with TFTP...but normal day to day users may not want the hassle.C.  SKIP IT.The conclusion from the above is that it is a great router when it works.  The issues with firmware upgrades make me believe that this revision (version 1) of the router is not ready for primetime.  As of this writing the router remains unplugged and unusable.  I will be contacting Netgear again to see if a replacement can be arranged so as to get rid of the firmware bugs.My opinion is that you skip this router and get something different or make sure that you are getting version 2 of this device.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "It works well, when it works.

In fact, I had the opportunity to compare it side-by-side with the Nikon version and found them to be identical in every way (down to the cut lines and the screw placements).  That gave me some confidence when buying this grip.Now, it's important to understand that the Nikon version of this grip, as I understand, is made of magnesium like the camera itself.  That makes for more of a difference than the D90 version since in this case we're talking plastic vs. metal.  It isn't metal in your hand, and you can tell.  Operationally, however, this grip is wonderful.  The multi-selector on the back works great, the shutter has a solid \"clicky\" feel, and the battery compartment works well without any movement or clunking around on the inside.  The camera recognizes it perfectly, and you can start using it right away.Overall, this grip is so much cheaper than the Nikon that anyone about to make this purchase should at least consider going with the Zeikos.  It's true that it may not match the build-quality of the Nikon, but the differences are slight and generally insignificant to daily operation.  Considering the savings, I have no regrets about purchasing the Zeikos, and I don't think you will either.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great alternative grip", "unixReviewTime": 1280102400, "reviewTime": "07 26, 2010"}

To say it is far superior is an understatement, in picture quality and software functionality.The camera arrived packed well.  The sunshade is a separate piece of formed aluminum that attaches with a single screw through a slotted hole to keep it properly aligned.  The mount is quite nice, all metal, with locknut to tighten at the camera and mounting plate.  There are two allen screws to tighten the angle adjustments.  This all combines to provide a very secure mount that won't change over time like \"ball\" mounts can do.Connections are via a cable that splits at the end.  The cable is about four feet long, before the split, with the pigtails being about 18\" long.  On the camera I received thee is an RJ45, a power connector and a BNC connector for local video when establishing field of view.  That, the BNC connector, seemed a little odd, but the box did not have any instructions or software included.  I downloaded everything from Grandstream when I ordered, so this was not a problem at all.  Keep in mind these connections are not weather proof and need to be enclosed in a weather proof container of some sort.  I'm using a plastic bag, temporarily, but will replace that with a weatherproof electrical box later this spring.The housing appears to be totally weather tight and probably dust tight as well.  The camera has only been up for about a week, but has already weathered everything from snow to rain, temperatures from about 10F to 70F and some pretty high winds. (East coast in the spring).  I am not worried about the durability of the camera or the mount at all.I used PoE with an injector, since this is the only camera I have at the moment.  It fired right up and configuration was quite easy using the software tools from Grandstream.  I don't think it took more than five minutes from unboxing to having a nice, quality, picture on my monitor.  The camera is connected through a 200 foot ethernet cable and works fine, both night and day, at that cable length.I mounted the camera outside and started working with the software for motion detection.  It was not particularly \"intuitive\" to me, but it wasn't all that hard to configure.  A detection zone number needs to be selected, then click the \"edit\" button, then place the cursor where the detection zone starts and drag to where it ends.  \"Save\" has to be clicked for each zone as they are created.  The sensitivity level also needs to be set and saved in a similar manner, but both can be saved at the same time.  All of this is done directly on the camera itself, accessed via the camera IP address, not the G-surf Pro software.The G-surf Pro software is pretty nice, again far better than Loftek.  The video is displayed at full frame rate and at full h264.  Reading a license plate at 50 feet, one of my requirements, is quite easy.  The playback end of the software is great.  It can play at full speed, of course, but also can play at from 1/8 speed to 8X speed.  This is really handy when examining saved clips for details, or just skimming through them to double check before deleting them.  I've been using file manager in conjunction with playback to delete, there is no file management tool I can find in the playback tool.Overall, I'm very happy with this camera and will be buying another to keep an eye on our driveway.  The next one will have the 3.6mm lens so I can get a wider view angle.  Keep in mind that this model comes with a 6mm lens that may not be appropriate for a lot of applications.  Yes, it is more expensive than a lot of other IP cameras, but in terms of \"bang for the buck\" it is more than worth the difference.I also want to mention that Grandstream has been very fast to respond to any \"help\" requests.  I did have a question about their forum and got an answer within a few hours.  That also adds to the value of the camera.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great camera", "unixReviewTime": 1394668800, "reviewTime": "03 13, 2014"}

Epperson\"", "helpful": [10, 26], "reviewText": "I sold my olympus e-510 last spring and have been waiting for olympus to come out with a better camera than the e-620. but when it was apparent that wasnt going to happen any time soon I had to have some kind of camera or I was going to go crazy! along comes the pen, and since I still had my Olympus 50mm macro, my 12-60 zoom, and my 70-300mm zoom lenses and this camera is supposed to be able to use these with the adapter, I thought o.k. sounds good lets give this a try in the interim while waiting for an upgrade to the e-620. Well here is what I have found to be, in my opinion, practically useless. As long as you are using the kit zoom that comes with this camera focusing is a nightmare. with the kit zoom the lens will focus and lock-in relatively quick, within a second or less. but no matter which one of my full size lenses I use it takes this camera from 4 or 5 full seconds to focus and lock-in! that is just ridiculously long. and on top of that you will be lucky if the camera has actually focused accurately, so it is impossible to have any confidence at all in whether your going to get a good picture or not when using any lens other than the ones specifically made for this camera! In addition this camera does not allow you to have any control over the ISO, the default is ISO 200, however when you are taking pictures and are in automatic the camera will set all three of the following, shutter speed, F-stop - and the ISO. you never know what the camera is going to choose! So when I wanted to use my 70-300 zoom with an f-5.6 - I needed to make sure the ISO was relatively high to keep the shutter speed up, but even in bright sunlight this camera simply refused to allow the focus to take any less than 5 seconds - then more often than not it would not let me take a picture because it was saying there was not enough light even in very bright sunlight! UNBELIEVABLE. Now if I could manually set the ISO to a highr range this should solve this problem but you cannot manually set the ISO! Now it may be the battery is not really big enough to allow my regular lenses to focus and operate properly, maybe, I dont know but there is no way I can use any of my lenses with any confidence at all that I will even get a picture let alone the fact that even when I do it must be a non-living or non-moving item because it takes soooooooo long to focus. In addition I took this to the beach the other day and even with the kit lens, thier was a guy sitting on the beach and he had been feeding the seagulls, so he must have had at least 300 birds at his feet. well at one point they all began to fly off, so I quick took a shot, then waited and waited and waited till the camera finally finished writing the picture to the card ( while your waiting the screen freezes and you just have to wait to take a second picture) by the time the camera finally let me take a second shot, all the 300 of the birds were gone baby gone! again RIDICULOUS! I give this camera 3 stars only because when you finally do get a picture taken the image quality is great. all my shots were taken with middle setting for quality - so I could go down in quality 2 notches or up in quality 2 notches with the best being in raw ( god only knows how long it would take this camera to write a raw image to the card, you could probably call your girlfriend while you wait! the screen is totally un-useable in any normal outside daylight - you cant see what the heck you are trying to focus on. - I will get rid of this pretty quick and just go ahead and buy the E620 at least I know that will work right the way it is suppose to, this camera does not. if you are hell bent on buying this anyway, you go girl! But make sure you only use the lens's that are actually made for this camera and dont believe for a second if you allready own any Olympus Lens's that the regular lenses are going to work for you - good luck and good night! - Ken Of Gulf Shores", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "What You Really Need To Know", "unixReviewTime": 1285718400, "reviewTime": "09 29, 2010"}

{"reviewerID": "A3D2HZLVBLVG9E", "asin": "B00HPQ09GM", "reviewerName": "Neutral grey", "helpful": [13, 15], "reviewText": "This is one amazing piece of engineering.  I used to use a Nikon D7100 for serious shooting, Fuji X-10 to carry everywhere, and an IPhone 5S in a pinch.  I was looking for something more portable than the D7100 and with more creative control than the X-10.  I nearly bought the Fuji X-T1 but when I learned that it was difficult to control the focus points, that was ruled out.  I was hesitant to go with any micro 4/3 until the EM-10 came out.  Since purchasing this I have not had the desire to use the D7100 or the X-10 and rarely use the IPhone.  Below are the pros and cons. It gets four stars rather than five only because of performance in sports and action photography was not on par with a DSLR, but their was a firmware upgrade in May 2014 and by setting \"Release Lag-Time\" to \"short\" it works much better for sport and I may upgrade my review to a 5 star later.Pros:1) Small size:  the camera is so incredibly small yet so usable.  It is actually smaller than the X-10. It's like having a miniature DSLR in your pocket.  It easily fits in your coat pocket or suit jacket pocket with the power zoom lens.  All the lenses are very small and can fit in your coat pocket.2) Design: The controls and menu system is great.  I never could get use to the controls on the D7100 and the controls on the EM-10 are so intuitive and user friendly. I mainly shoot full manual and I can quickly control aperture and shutter speed with the command dials and access the ISO and white balance to control with the two command dials.  It also has auto ISO in full manual which is great.3) Focus points: There are 81 focus points throughout the screen that are easily controlled by the directional dial. Whenever you press the direction dial it will control the direction of the focus point.  Nothing else needs to be done. I know of no other camera that has this feature or that can control focus point so easily.  That is reason alone to purchase this cameral for me. The D7100 had 51 focus point that were all bunched up in the center.4) Electronic view finder (EVF):  If you have never tried an EVF, please do so. After using an EVF, I could never go back to an optical view finder (OVF).  The image quality is so much better, bigger and brighter then with D7100 OVF.  What you see is what you get. The exposure and white balance changes that you make are reflected in the EVF.  There is no guesswork in the exposure.  You rarely have to rely in the light meter.  You can also play back photos in the EVF. Even in the brightest outdoor lighting you can playback the photos in the EVF.5) The tilting touch screen:  This feature is to die for.  No longer do you have to lie on the ground to get a creative shot.  You flip out the touch screen and tap the screen with your finger where you want the photo to focus and be exposed.  While I prefer to use the EVF when possible, this really comes in handy for the hard to get shots. The focus is also blazing fast.6) Video with image capture:  DSLR's are terrible for video.  The live view is awful and the autofocus is noisy.  Not with this camera.  The focus is spot on and totally silent. Best of all, you can do completely silent image capture while recording video.  No longer do you have to choose between video and photo.  You can snap away during video and nail great pictures very fast.7) Easy access to advanced features:  Custom white balance, HDR, bracketing and multiple exposure are so easy to use and much better than the D7100. It would take to long to explain each one. For custom white balance, you just point it a white sheet of patient, snap a picture and your done.  You now have perfect white balance during difficult lighting.8) Low light performance: In my opinion this camera is superior in low light to the APS-C D7100.  As far as I am concerned, it is very good up to ISO 6,400 and totally usable up to 10,000.  Most reviews would disagree with me, but unless you are pixel peeping and cropping, that's been my experience.9) Auto focus:  The singe auto focus is blazing fast and accurate.10)  Menus system: While not necessarily intuitive, it is logical, easy to use, easy to learn and easy to access.  The manual is good.11)  Built in image stabilization: It works12)  Lenses: Multiple great lenses to choose from. Excellent fast prime lenses. The 14 - 42 mm pancake power zoom with built in lens cap is so incredibly convenient.  You have to see it to believe it.13)  Image quality: With the prime lenses the image quality is equal to or better than the D7100.  With the kit lenses the image quality is good, but not on par with the D7100 using my Tamron 28 - 75/f2.8 and 70 - 300 mm. Not a fair comparison though.14) JPEGS:  The JPEGs are so good that you hardly need any post-processing.15) Manual focus peeking:  I rarely use it, but it is a nice feature.16) Small lens diameter: Because the lenses are so small you can shoot through a chain fence at a little league baseball game.17) Design: I like the retro DSLR look and feel.Cons:1) Continuous auto-focus and auto-focus tracking: READ THIS CAREFULLY.  This camera does not focus in the same way as a DSLR.  Contrast detection is different from phase detection.  This is important when it comes shooting sports or children playing. Faces do not have a lot of contrast and if you focus on a face of children playing the camera may focus on the background.  This is not important with portrait photography, but with people at a distance it is a real problem.  There is a way around this, though.  You have to pick the smallest focus point. Go to the focus point menu. At the bottom left of the screen you can control focus point size and face detection. Select the smallest focus point size, the camera DOES NOT come set this way and you won't easily find it in the manual. Also select the large superfine JPEG (check the manual). You have to go into the menu system to do this.  Most important, focus on shirts and not faces.  Shirts have a lot more contrast and you will get better results.a. The autofocus tracking works, but is unreliable.  Nowhere on par with a DSLR. Best avoid using it if possible. Don't believe the Youtube tests. Yes, the autofocus tracking will work great on a brightly colored motorcyle circling on a dirt track. It will not work for a small child running around a cluttered playground.b. The continuous autofocus works pretty well, but you can't see the focus point in the screen when taking multiple shots at either 3 FPS or 8 FPS.  With the D7100 the focus point were always lit up red, in the EM-10 it lights up green once and not again.  The focus point is otherwise so faint you really cant see where it is.  You have to just put it in the center of the screen for action and keep the subject in the center of the screen.c. For fast moving sports there was a noticeable delay between what you see and what is actually occurring until the May 2014 firmware update and by setting the \"Release Lag-Time\" to \"short\".2) Does not have quiet or silent mode for photography.  The shutter release is little loud, so less than ideal for street photography.Conclusions:  Amazing camera, small and convenient, great low light performance, image quality on par with a DSLR, excellent controls and functionality, attractive design, great lenses. Did not initially excel at sports and action photography but with a recent firmware upgrade and setting the \"Release Lag-Time\" to \"short\", focus speed is now outsanding may exceed a DSLR.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Pocket Hercules", "unixReviewTime": 1400976000, "reviewTime": "05 25, 2014"}

The fact that the head is tight deters me a lot from ever using it, especially not when I just needed to listen to something.  I ended up buying another earbud + mic thing instead for even cheaper ($6) and now I use that far more than this.  The pain factor (or just headache factor) is a little too great for my liking.  :\\  I do have to admit, quality with this is better than my other earbud (though that thing original price was also in the $50+), but that might be because I have that weird cover thing on my earbud.  That said, I want to change my rating to 3 stars but it's not letting me.  lolFirst, note that this is a USB headset, not the old type with the plug for mic and plug for audio, which essentially means the audio and mic goes hand in hand.  I didn't realize this when I purchased it until it arrived, so just a heads up.The sound is clear though the noise cancellation part doesn't seem so obvious to me, but that may be because the last noise cancelling headphones I used was the Bose kind that worked REALLY well.  I bought this to play games online while talking with my friend.  It works well with Skype, and I was able to hear my friend and talk to her even while the bgm and sound effects of the game were on.I've only had it for a couple of weeks and only used it a handful of times so I can't say much about durability yet, but the one thing that did take down a star for me was how tight it is.  The ear part fits around your ears, but due to the tightness of the entire headset, it still gave me a headache within an hour.  Because it's USB, I was not able to separate it by using my speakers for listening and just using the mic.  I think maybe if your head's smaller it's less of a problem?  Or possibly I need to break them in a bit first so that it won't be so tight.I guess the only good thing is it prevents me from playing for a really long time!
